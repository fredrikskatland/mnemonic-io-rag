      "Advisory: Critical RCE vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2023-50164) \n",
      "\n",
      " Critical vulnerability found in the widely used development framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications Apache Struts \n",
      "\n",
      " On December 7th, 2023, Apache released an update that addresses a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Struts. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-50164 and has Apache Struts is a versatile framework for developing Java web applications, known for its efficiency in creating scalable and easily maintainable solutions. It follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and is widely utilised by various vendors in their product and services portfolio, and by organisations as in-house built applications.The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by manipulating file upload parameters, potentially leading to the upload of malicious files and subsequent server-side detonation (e.g. JSP files).At this time, mnemonic's assessment is that the vulnerability poses a medium-to-high threat for organisations for the following reasons:We consider the following factors to lower the risk level at this stage:We emphasise that this is a developing vulnerability and new information is likely to impact the threat level over the coming weeks.The following versions of the framework are vulnerable:Vendors are currently assessing their exposure to this vulnerability, such as:The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within file upload parameters of the \"ActionSupport\" class, allowing attackers to upload malicious files and execute arbitrary code on the targeted server. The class exhibits a bug in filename parameter filtering during file uploads, allowing arbitrary file write on a Struts Java server. This capability enables attackers to write server-side rendered files, like JSP files, into a target directory. Upon requesting the file, the JSP payload is executed, resulting in a compromised server.Successful exploitation involves uploading two files in a single POST request via the 'upload.action' action, with the first being benign and the second containing path traversal strings in the 'uploadFileName' parameter, (e.g. \"../../\"). As an example, for a web shell to be successfully deployed, the dropped file (e.g. 'webshell.jsp') must be in a valid route that an attacker can remotely reach, which will vary between implementations. This is likely to encourage vendor-specific research to determine the precise path for dropping a web shell.The exploitation of CVE-2023-50164 involves several preconditions that are dependent on the behaviour and implementation of the application using Apache Struts:mnemonic recommends the following actions:We are continuously monitoring the situation and developing detection logic for our Argus services. \n",
