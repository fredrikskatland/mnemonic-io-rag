{"solution_description": "The Internet is home to more than 360 million domain names, and every hour, thousands more are added. New websites are launched every minute, and attackers compromise legitimate websites to target unsuspecting victims. This landscape changes by the second, and challenges organisations to protect your users, data and business operations.Secure DNS is a free service that prevents computers from reaching websites known to be a threat. If a user or system requests a known malicious domain, Secure DNS will intercept the request and redirect the user to a safe website informing them of the risk that was averted.The service only takes minutes to set up, operates transparently to users with no additional latency, is very robust with high up-time, and is powered by mnemonic’s global Threat Intelligence to provide organisations with real-time protection in this ever-changing landscape.We have years of experience monitoring and assessing the threat landscape and providing Threat Intelligence deliverables. This gives a solid knowledge of and insight into how threat actors operate, and the techniques and infrastructure they use in order to successfully compromise organisations.mnemonic's Threat Intelligence department consists of highly experienced and trained cyber threat intelligence analysts, that works continuously in their pursuit of understanding how threat actors operate and how these may be combated. This knowledge is key in delivering a service that not only blocks traditional malware, but also includes highly targeted and persistent threats that other commercial DNS protection services do not cover.The vast amount of telemetry data we collect from our global intelligence network, are filtered and enriched through various fingerprinting methods to identify new and emerging threats, and to track threat actor activity. This information is used in addition to the intelligence from incident response cases we handled on a daily basis, to ensure that the Secure DNS service has a highly-accurate and timely relevant threat coverage to best protect our customers.As part of our enterprise upgrades these alternatives are available:Configure your primary DNS server to be 185.247.99.99 (IPv6: 2a02:2188::99) and you’re ready to go. This can be done locally on your device, home router, or by your IT team on your corporate DNS service.Want added security with DNSSEC? Use 185.247.99.100 (IPv6: 2a02:2188::100) instead. DNSSEC is not universally adopted across the Internet, and may result in legitimate websites that do not support DNSSEC being blocked.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/solutions/secure-dns/"},

{"solution_description": "With employees now accessing critical internal information, internal systems and an increasing number of cloud services from everywhere, the focus has shifted towards the importance of protecting the endpoints in a lot more depth than what was common in the past. While antivirus and OS patching is still just as important as before, the need for full visibility combined with new security technologies has increased dramatically.Organisations are now moving towards more modern capabilities delivered by Managed Detection and Response (MDR) vendors like mnemonic. A core service within MDR has always been to harden endpoint security and maximise visibility.To be able to perform threat hunting and efficient incident response, access to all recorded activities is a key requirement. Without the full visibility from all endpoints and servers in your environment, incident response will be a tough task and will need to rely on a fragmented and limited data set, indicators and less hard-coded evidence.As the threat landscape has changed dramatically just over the last few years, with many critical attacks documented in public, mnemonic has decided to introduce a new platform for the Argus Endpoint Responder service: CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection. This product and this vendor has proven to deliver the best detection capabilities and the most flexible threat hunting tools to ensure mnemonic can provide services that protect customers in the best possible way.Modern incident response, investigations and threat hunting require much more detailed logs and longer log retention than what was required in the past. Argus Endpoint Responder powered by CrowdStrike technology will provide customers with the best security tooling to secure your endpoints.Argus Endpoint Responder is a module of a complete Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service.
